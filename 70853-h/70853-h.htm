</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TWO main objects have been kept in view in the preparation of the
present volume.</p>

<p>The first was to render generally accessible some of those beautiful
but comparatively unknown examples of old tartans represented in family
portraits, miniatures, and relics, as well as in the few collections
of tartans which exist in the country, and to set forth all that could
be definitely ascertained regarding their origin and history. To carry
this out efficiently, it was necessary to obtain the permission of
the families possessing representations and examples of the tartans
to inspect them, and to visit the different localities in Scotland
in which they are preserved, for the purposes of examination and
illustration. By the courtesy of the owners every facility and aid was
given in the work of recording and identifying the setts, and in no
case where permission was asked to reproduce a tartan was it refused.
This preliminary work extended over a period of several years, in the
course of which the Editor believes he allowed few collections to
escape his notice. From the great number of setts now in his note-books
he found the utmost difficulty in making the selection for the present
work, and the exigencies of space alone have compelled him, to his
regret, to omit many rare, beautiful, and historic examples he would
willingly have included.</p>

<p>Having arranged as to the examples of tartan to appear in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span> the volume,
it became necessary to decide on the form of illustration. Hitherto
the modes adopted in works of this description have been admittedly
unsatisfactory, it being impossible, by the highest exercise of skill
in colour printing, to render the shades correctly, particularly in
those portions of the setts where the colours are crossed. Solid
colours are generally rendered adequately by lithography, but when
the most important and intricate portion of the design—viz., the
representation of the interweaving of different shades—is in question,
none of the processes of colour printing yet invented does justice
to the great beauty of the actual fabric. The method adopted in the
present work has been to weave the tartan to be represented in its
proper colours in fine silk. The shades required for each specimen
having been dyed, the weaving was executed by the hand-loom in exact
proportion to the original. To ensure permanency the mounting was
arranged so that no portion of the silk forming the illustration should
come into contact with the adhesive.</p>

<p>The second object kept in view in the preparation of the work was
to examine and present, in something like chronological order, the
references in old writers to tartan and the Highland dress. The only
attempt of the kind hitherto made was that by Donald Gregory and W.
F. Skene, included in the <cite>Transactions of the Iona Club</cite>. Since that
valuable work was published a great deal of interesting and original
material has been discovered. But what may be termed the literature of
the subject is so widely diffused, and contained in works so difficult
of access to the general reader—many of them being in MS., and others
rare and costly—that it seemed to be of importance to present these
notices in a form which would render easy comparison between different
ages and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span> authors. Something of this kind the Editor has endeavoured
to carry out in the Introduction. Particular attention has been paid
to the accuracy of the extracts, which have been carefully verified
by comparison with the authorities. One result has been the discovery
of serious errors in quotations by previous writers, and the more
important of these are pointed out. The Editor trusts that, considering
the importance of the objects he had in view, the length to which
several of the extracts have unavoidably run will be pardoned by his
readers. He has omitted many references which he regarded as of minor
consequence, while several of much importance are given for the first
time.</p>

<p>There remains the pleasant duty of thanking those by whose aid the
Editor has been enabled to produce the work.</p>

<p>Her Majesty the Queen permitted the Balmoral Tartan as used by the
Royal Family to be reproduced, and communicated an account of its
origin. Miss Dick Lauder placed at the disposal of the Editor the
unique copy of the <cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite> made by her father at
Relugas in 1828-29 from the manuscript in possession of the Messrs
Hay, and also the correspondence between Sir Walter Scott and Sir
Thomas Dick Lauder, so fully referred to in the Introduction. Mrs
Charles Elphinstone Dalrymple kindly supplied transcripts of notes on
tartans and the Highland dress made by the late Mr Charles Elphinstone
Dalrymple, and lent several paintings and drawings, as well as a
collection of tartans made by the Highland Society of London and the
late Dr. W. F. Skene. To Mr Alexander Donald Mackenzie, Edinburgh, the
Editor has been indebted for many valuable suggestions from the first
inception of his work; and the fruits of Mr Mackenzie’s study of Gaelic
literature and customs were freely placed at his disposal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span></p>

<p>Opportunities of inspecting paintings and taking notes of the tartans
depicted were kindly granted by His Grace the Duke of Sutherland,
the Right Hon. the Earl of Eglinton, the Right Hon. the Earl of
Ancaster, the Right Hon. the Countess of Seafield, the Right Hon. Lord
Macdonald of the Isles, the Right Hon. Lord Donington, Macleod of
Macleod, Cluny Macpherson, The Mackintosh of Mackintosh, the Hon. Mrs
R. Baillie-Hamilton, Mr and Mrs Nisbet-Hamilton-Ogilvy, John Alastair
Erskine Cunninghame, Esquire of Balgownie, Captain W. Home Drummond
Moray of Abercairney, and Frederick Granville Sinclair, Esquire of
Barrogill.</p>

<p>The collections of tartans preserved by several families were also
placed at the disposal of the Editor.</p>

<p>Information and assistance on various points connected with the
subject were accorded by the Most Hon. the Marquis of Ailsa, the Most
Hon. the Marchioness of Breadalbane, Lord Archibald Campbell, Sir
Arthur Halkett of Pitfirrane, Bart., Miss Fraser of Abertarff, Walter
Douglas Campbell, Esquire of Blythswood, James Campbell, Esquire,
representative of the Campbells of Craignish, Mr Godwin, Librarian to
the Marquis of Bute, Mrs Tilly, London, and others.</p>

<p>To Dr. Thomas Dickson, Curator of the Historical Department H.M.
Register House, and to Mr Andrew Ross, Marchmont Herald, the Editor is
indebted for valuable direction in regard to many points contained in
the Introduction.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OF the dress of the Highlanders of Scotland prior to the fifteenth
century the descriptions available are few and meagre. True, there
are many references to a style of costume which consisted mainly of
a loose outer garment, but these are equally applicable to the wear
of neighbouring countries, and contain no account of the distinctive
features associated with the Highland dress. Probably the earliest
reference to the latter is to be found in the Saga of Magnus Barefoot,
King of Norway, 1093-1103, who led marauding expeditions to the west of
Scotland in the first year of his reign and subsequently. Of his return
from such a raid the historian chronicles:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>People say that when King Magnus came home from his viking cruise to
the Western countries, he and many of his people brought with them a
great deal of the habits and fashions of clothing of those Western
parts. They went about on the streets with bare legs, and had short
kirtles and over-cloaks; and therefore his men called him Magnus
Barefoot or Bareleg.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The word “kyrtlu” probably indicates a garment corresponding somewhat
to the feilebeg or kilt, though it may also indicate one which covered
the upper portion of the body as well, and thus formed a species
of tunic.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Still, the description of the distinctive costume of
the Western Islanders at this remote period is extremely valuable,
especially as it is written by one who lived so near the time when
the incidents narrated took place. In accordance with the custom of
fosterage then prevalent in Norway, and continued in Scotland long
afterwards, Snorro Sturleson, the author of the Saga, was reared with
the children of the king’s daughter, and so had opportunity of hearing
and noting the use of the strange costume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>The chartularies of Aberdeen attest the use not merely of the style of
dress that figures in the Saga, but also of a parti-coloured cloth,
which was probably tartan. In these ancient records are notes on early
customs of the utmost importance to antiquaries. They contain, besides
the charters of the lands belonging to the See, the canons of the
Scottish Church, and the statutes of the Church of Aberdeen, framed in
the thirteenth century; it is there provided that “all ecclesiastics
are to be suitably apparelled, avoiding red, green, and striped
clothing, and their garments shall not be shorter than to the middle
of the leg.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Of course, it cannot be held that this conclusively
proves the existence of breacan or tartan, but striped clothing is as
near an approach to an accurate description of it as can be expected
at so early a period. The injunctions indicate a general use of
parti-coloured garments in the northern districts of the country in the
thirteenth century.</p>

<p>The famous clan battle on the North Inch of Perth took place in 1396,
but only the slightest reference is made to the dress of the combatants
in any of the accounts now extant. In the narrative by Abbot Bower, the
continuator of Fordun, it is recorded that the battle was waged</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By thirty men against thirty of the opposite party, armed only with
swords, bows and arrows, without mantles or other armour except
axes.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The mantle is doubtless the over-cloak of Magnus Barefoot’s time, and
the prototype of the plaid often so designated by writers of later date.</p>

<p>Borthwick in his <cite>Antiquities</cite><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> prints the Accounts for 1474 of John,
Bishop of Glasgow, Treasurer to James III., which contain the entry:
“Halve ane elne of double tartan to lyne riding collars to the queen.”
Pinkerton adopts Borthwick’s reading.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Pitcairn cites entries, under
date October 1488, of a fabric called “tarter,”and he adds “this is
evidently tartan.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Had the conclusions of these antiquaries as
to the identity of the words been correct, then these would be the
earliest specific references to tartan hitherto discovered in our
records; but that they are not is pointed out by the editor of the
<cite>Treasurer’s Accounts</cite>, who writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tartar, the name of which bespeaks its Eastern origin, though it was
no doubt imitated by the weavers of Italy and France, is described as
“single” or “double,” according to texture, and as “variant” or shot,
the warp and woof being of contrasted colours. This not uncommon word
has been frequently misread “tartan,” and examples <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>of its occurrence
quoted from the <cite>Treasurer’s Accounts</cite> as illustrative of the early
use of that material.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The opinion of such eminent antiquaries has misled all subsequent
writers of important works relating to tartans, with the exception of
John Sobieski Stuart and W. F. Skene; even works appearing many years
after the issue of the <cite>Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer</cite> continue
to perpetuate the old errors.</p>

<p>There is a significant passage in the old Gaelic tale of “Curio,”
describing the giant Anteus, which runs thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><cite lang="sco">Nibidh dono tuighi na craibheach, na pell, no brotrach, na brecan, na
crocend anmanna, fui isin leapaidh sin acht a thaoebh fri sin talmain.</cite></p>

<p>Now he had not thatch, nor branches, nor hide, nor coverlet, nor
breacan [<em>i.e.</em>, tartan, or tartan plaid], nor skin under him in that
bed, but his side to the earth.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
</div>

<p>“Brecan,” literally a speckled or variegated cloth, has been employed
in the Gaelic language as synonymous with tartan and the tartan plaid
from earliest times, in evident allusion to the checked or spotted
appearance of the garment. “Breac” signifies parti-coloured or spotted.
It is a Gaelic name of the salmon and of the trout, conferred, no
doubt, on account of their speckled aspect.</p>

<p>A curious fifteenth century reference to “hewyt,” <em>i.e.</em>, coloured,
striped, or variegated clothing, occurs in a sumptuary law of the Scots
Parliament:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><cite lang="sco">Item it is statut that na yeman na comonner to landwarts wer hewyt
clathes siddar na the kne na yit ragyt clathes bot allenarly centynal
yemen in lords housis at rids with gentill men thar masters the
quhilks sal haf narow slewis and litil poks.</cite><a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The introduction of printing naturally tended to produce and to
preserve many descriptions of the Highland dress written in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries by Scottish historians and by
travellers from other countries. Of the more important of these, the
earliest in chronological order is John Major (1469-1550), whose work
was originally published in Latin in 1521. He writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Just as among the Scots we find two distinct tongues, so we likewise
find two different <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>ways of life and conduct. For some are born in
the forests and mountains of the north, and these we call men of the
Highland, but the others men of the Lowland. By foreigners the former
are called Wild Scots, the latter householding Scots. The Irish tongue
is in use among the former, the English tongue among the latter. One
half of Scotland speaks Irish, and all these as well as the Islanders
we reckon to belong to the Wild Scots. In dress, in the manner of
their outward life, and in good morals, for example, these come behind
the householding Scots.... From the mid-leg to the foot they go
uncovered; their dress is, for an over garment, a loose plaid, and a
shirt saffron-dyed. They are armed with bow and arrows, a broadsword,
and a small halbert. They always carry in their belt a stout dagger,
single-edged, but of the sharpest. In time of war they cover the whole
body with a coat of mail, made of iron rings, and in it they fight.
The common folk among the Wild Scots go out to battle with the whole
body clad in a linen garment sewed together in patchwork, well daubed
with wax or with pitch, and with an over-coat of deerskin. But the
common people among our domestic Scots and the English fight in a
woollen garment.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>
</div>

<p>From these and other passages in Major’s work it may be inferred that
the chiefs and upper classes of the Highlands alone wore the plaid, or
any woollen clothing whatever, and that the lower orders were prevented
by poverty from obtaining luxuries of this sort. Writing of the clan
battle at Perth in 1396, Major states:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thirty men, naked but for a doublet that hung from one side, made
for the field of battle, armed with bow and double-axe; and these
forthwith met the encounter of a like number, armed in the same
fashion.... One of the combatants made his escape from the fight....
And there was not found any man who would take the place of the
runaway; and ’twas no marvel, since to fight for your life, naked but
for a plaid, is no trifle.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In his account of the revolt of Alexander, Lord of the Isles, against
the king, describing the Wild Scots, and particularly Clan Chattan and
Clan Cameron, Major observes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They lead a life of blissful ease; from the poor people they take
what they want in victual; bows they have, and quivers, and they have
halberts of great sharpness, for their iron ore is good. They carry a
stout dirk in their belts; they are often naked from the knee down. In
winter for an over garment they wear a plaid.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The costume thus consisted of a short “variant cullorit” Highland coat,
tartan hose—that is, trews and stockings combined—and three “syde” or
low-hanging Highland shirts (each of which, it would appear, contained
five ells), with ties of ribbons at the cuffs. The trews, described in
the extract as “hoiss,” extended from the waist to the foot, and were
tied with a garter below the knee.</p>

<p>Doubts have been cast, indeed, on the possibility of existence in the
rigours of a northern winter with the scanty raiment attributed to
the poorer classes, but these are dispelled by the evidence on the
point. Preserved in the British Museum is a remarkable letter written
in 1542 or 1543 by John Elder, clerk, a “Reddshancke,” to Henry VIII.,
proposing the union of Scotland with England. The following excerpt
affords positive testimony of the hardihood of the people, and of the
title “Reddshanckes” conferred upon them by the Lowlanders:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That the clothing of the Highlanders at this period was parti-coloured,
or tartan, is evident from a foreign traveller’s record almost
contemporaneous with John Elder’s epistle. Jean de Beaugué, who
accompanied the expedition sent in 1548 by Henry II. of France under
Montalembert, Sieur d’Essé, to aid the Scots against the English,
wrote an account of his observations, printed in Paris in 1556. Of
the appearance of certain Islanders among the troops at the siege of
Haddington in the latter year he observes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Several Highlanders [or Wild Scots] followed them [the Scottish
army] and they were naked except their stained shirts, and a certain
light covering made of wool of various colours; carrying large
bows, and similar swords and bucklers to the others, <em>i.e.</em> to the
Lowlanders.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Proof is thus supplied of the continued use of the Highland shirt,
generally saffron-dyed; and the “light covering” was doubtless the
mantle or breacan, the belted plaid, for this last is either identical
with or a development of the over-cloak of Magnus Barefoot’s time.</p>

<p>In 1552 the Scottish Privy Council passed an Act for the formation of
“<cite lang="sco">tua ansaingyeis of fittmen</cite>,” to be raised in the Highland portion of
Lord Huntly’s lieutenancy, for service in France. The instructions laid
down for their equipment afford some idea of the dress of the Highland
soldier of the period, since the levy was to be drawn from the north
country. It is provided that the men are to be</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><cite lang="sco">Substantiouslie accomptirit with jack and plait, steilbonett, sword,
bucklair, new hois and new dowblett of cannvus at the lest, and slevis
of plait or splenttis, and ane speir of sax elnes lang or thairby.</cite><a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The trews (hois) and doublet are to be of canvas at least, presumably
as a precaution against any shortcoming of woollen stuff; while
the kilt or plaid appears to form no portion of the outfit on this
occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>Of the dress of the common people another description, written about
1573, is given by Lindsay of Pitscottie. It is once more obvious
that the belted plaid of latter days was then represented by a loose
garment, which was probably plaited round the body to some extent. The
chronicle sets forth:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><cite lang="sco">The other pairt [of Scotland] northerne, ar full of montaines, and
verie rud and homlie kynd of people doeth inhabite, which is called

with ane schirt fachioned (or saffroned) after the Irisch maner, going
bair legged to the knie. Thair weapones ar bowis and dartes, with ane
verie broad sword and ane dagger scharp onlie at the on syd.</cite><a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
</div>

<p>But the most detailed notice of the dress worn by the inhabitants of
the Highlands and Islands in the sixteenth century is to be found in a
work by John Leslie, Bishop of Ross, the devoted adherent of Mary Queen
of Scots, originally published in Rome in 1578. From his conspicuous
position, alike as historian and as statesman, his notes on the apparel
of the men and women of his age are highly important. It appears that
the belted plaid had become the wear of both rich and poor, through the
extended manufacture of woollen fabrics and the increased prosperity of
the people. He writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The editor in his notes to Book I. observes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">braccæ</i> is generally understood to be equivalent to our
<em>breeks</em>. There are, however, traces of the Latin word being used in
a wider sense to mean a loose flowing garment. Bishop Leslie here
applies it to the plaid or tartan, and, as it would seem, on the
ground of the variegated colours expressed by the Gaelic <em>breac</em>. This
is felt even in the use of the Latin word. We find <em>braccæ</em> described
as <em>pictæ</em> and <em>virgatæ</em>, coloured and striped. Perhaps the original
<em>braccæ</em>, which so took the attention of the Romans when they met
the Gauls, were striped and parti-coloured, and so gave rise to the
name. In Irish <em>breacan</em> still means a plaid. It would seem, then,
that the Latin word is borrowed from Celtic. The modern word <em>breeks</em>
or <em>breeches</em> is a double plural, and stands for <em>brec</em>, plural of
Anglo-Saxon <em>broc</em>. This last reminds us of Celtic <em>brog</em>, a shoe.
<em>Broc</em> can hardly be derived from either <em>breac</em> or <em>brog</em>, for we
find corresponding forms in all the Teutonic dialects. Neither can
<em>broc</em> mean speckled, for we have <em>freck</em>, <em>freckle</em>, to represent
<em>breac</em>. The Teutonic words, together with <em>brog</em>, may thus be cognate
terms expressing the sense of <em>cover</em> or <em>protect</em>, perhaps allied to
Anglo-Saxon <em>beorgan</em>. Comp. <em>bark</em>, the covering of a tree. <em>Brock</em>
in modern English and Scots means a badger; but this is clearly
the Gaelic <em>broc</em>. The animal was so named from its colour—pie or
speckle.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It has been held that this particular account, while establishing the
use of tartans by the chiefs or nobles, proves them to have been by
no means common wear. But, taken in conjunction with the writings of
Buchanan, a few years later, the interpretation seems to be that, while
the leaders preferred the more <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>brilliantly coloured patterns, the
rank and file had quieter designs, at once more economical and more
serviceable.</p>

<p>George Buchanan in his <cite>History</cite>, published in 1582, furnishes a
detailed account of the dress and arms of the Highlanders. He writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>They delight in variegated garments, especially stripped, and their
favourite colours are purple and blue. Their ancestors wore plaids of
many different colours, and numbers still retain this custom, but the
majority, now, in their dress, prefer a dark brown, imitating nearly
the leaves of the heather, that when lying upon the heath in the day,
they may not be discovered by the appearance of their clothes; in
these, wrapped rather than covered, they brave the severest storms
in the open air, and sometimes lay themselves down to sleep even in
the midst of snow. In their houses, also, they lie upon the ground;
strewing fern, or heath, on the floor, with the roots downward and the
leaves turned up. In this manner they form a bed so pleasant, that it
may vie in softness with the finest down, while in salubrity it far
exceeds it; for heath, naturally possessing the power of absorption,
drinks up the superfluous moisture, and restores strength to the
fatigued nerves, so that those who lie down languid and weary in
the evening, arise in the morning vigorous and sprightly. They have
all, not only the greatest contempt for pillows, or blankets, but,
in general, an affectation of uncultivated roughness, and hardihood,
so that when choice, or necessity induces them to travel in other
countries, they throw aside the pillows, and blankets of their hosts,
and wrapping themselves round with their own plaids, thus go to sleep,
afraid lest these barbarian luxuries, as they term them, should
contaminate their native simple hardiness. Their defensive armour
consists of an iron headpiece and a coat of mail, formed of small
iron rings, and frequently reaching to the heels. Their weapons are,
for the most part, a bow, and arrows barbed with iron, which cannot
be extracted without widely enlarging the orifice of the wound; but
a few carry swords or Lochaber axes. Instead of a trumpet they use
a bagpipe. They are exceedingly fond of music, and employ harps of
a peculiar kind, some of which are strung with brass, and some with
catgut. In playing they strike the wires either with a quill, or with
their nails, suffered to grow long for the purpose; but their grand
ambition is to adorn their harps with great quantities of silver and
gems, those who are too poor to afford jewels substituting crystals in
their stead. Their songs are not inelegant, and, in general, celebrate
the praises of brave men; their bards seldom choosing any other
subject.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>In the Acts and Proceedings of the General Assembly of the Kirk of
Scotland for the year 1575 the following ordinance against the use of
sumptuous clothing by Ministers and Readers of the Church is recorded:—</p>

<p>In view of what the old writers point out, that the early dress of
the Irish people bore a close resemblance to that of the Scottish
Highlanders, the description given by John Derricke in 1581 is valuable
as attesting the prevalence in his time of the two forms of the
dress—the kilt and the trews. It runs thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This second sort of dress, namely, a short woollen jacket, with

</div>

<p>Of the dress and arms of the Highlanders at the close of the sixteenth
century some details are furnished by M. Nicolay d’Arfeville,
Cosmographer to the King of France, in an account of a visit to
Scotland, published at Paris in 1583. The following is a translation of
a portion of his description:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Those who inhabit Scotland to the south of the Grampian chain, are
tolerably civilized and obedient to the laws, and speak the English
language; but those who inhabit <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>the north are more rude, homely, and
unruly, and for this reason are called savages [or Wild Scots.] They
wear, like the Irish, a large and full shirt, coloured with saffron,
and over this a garment hanging to the knee, of thick wool, after the
manner of a cassock. They go with bare heads, and allow their hair to
grow very long, and they wear neither stockings nor shoes, except some
who have buskins made in a very old fashion, which come as high as
their knees.</p>

<p>Their arms are the bow and arrow, and some darts, which they throw
with great dexterity, and a large sword, with a single-edged dagger.
They are very swift of foot, and there is no horse so swift as to
outstrip them, as I have seen proved several times, both in England
and Scotland.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
</div>

<p>One of the most striking and specific references to tartan is to
be found in the year 1587, and it occurs in connection with the
lands of Norraboll, in the island of Islay. In the Crown charter of
Novodamus, dated 19th March 1587-8, granted to Hector Makclene, son and
heir-apparent of Lauchlan Makclene of Dowart, the feu-duty for these
lands is specified as:-</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><cite lang="sco">Pro Nerrabollsadh 60 ulnas panni, albi, nigri, et grosei coloris
respective, et ulnam panni in augmentationem rentalis (vel 8 den pro
qualibet ulna).</cite><a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
</div>

<p>John Sobieski Stuart, who first drew attention to this entry,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
quotes the word “grosei” as “grisei,” and adds “in this enumeration
there appears a slight error, from a presumption that the third colour
should have been green. The word undoubtedly in each case is “grosei,”
and is so printed in the Record Issue. What was meant by “grosei”
we learn from two sources. In the signature upon which the Crown
charter above quoted proceeds, the lands and the feu-duty exigible are
thus described:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><cite lang="sco">All and haill the foirnamit fyve merk landis of Nerrabolsadh with
the pertinentis the sowme of lx ellis claith quhite blak and grene
cullouris respective or viii<sup>d</sup> vsuall money of this realme for ilk ell

price thereof in augmentation of the rentale mair nor euir the same
payit of befor.</cite><a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>
</div>

<p>These lands formerly belonged to the “Abbot of the Isle of Iona.”
They were annexed to the Crown at the period of the alteration of the
State religion in Scotland in the sixteenth century, and feued out to
Makclene <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>of Dowart on the conditions referred to, and they appear in
the Register of Temporalities belonging to the Crown in this form:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<cite lang="sco">fewmaillis of the fyve merk lands of Narraboll liand within the said

</div>

<p>John Sobieski Stuart’s transcriber had failed to give him the full
reference by omitting the words “et ulnam panni in augmentationem
rentalis,” which, taken in connection with the two contemporary
vernacular readings above given, settles that the cloth was not to be
of three separate pieces, each of an individual colour, but cloth in
which the dyes specified were interwoven.</p>

<p>But more remains to be said about this remarkable feu-duty. About
1617 Makclene of Dowart appears to have got into difficulties. At all
events, in that year a Crown charter of the lands was granted to Rorie
M’Kenzie of Cogeauche. The reddendo is identical with that in the
charter of 1587-8 already quoted, but the signature is in these words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>

<p>When the lands were restored in 1630 to Makclene of Dowart, while the
Latin charter remains unchanged, the signature is in these words:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>For the <cite lang="sco">foirsaid fyve merk land of Morrabulsadtir with the

</div>

<p>The explanation is simple enough. White and black and green are the
only colours in the oldest authenticated Mac Lean tartan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>The evidence of all accounts of the costume of the people inhabiting
the northern and western portions of Scotland in the sixteenth century
attests the use of the yellow saffron-dyed shirt, and the cloak,
cassock or plaid, reaching to about the knee, as the ordinary dress.
A reference to a yellow coat, which appears to have been a garment
distinct from the yellow shirt, is found at this period. It occurs in
a <cite>History of the Gordons</cite>, preserved in the Advocates’ Library, which
states that in 1590:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Angus, the son of Lachlan, chiefe of the Clanchattan, with a great
party attempts to surpryze the Castle of Ruthven in Badenoch,
belonging to Huntly, in which there was but a small garrison; but
finding this attempt could neither by force nor fraude have successe,
he retires a little to consult how to compasse his intent. In the
meanetyme, one creeps out under the shelter of some old ruines, and
levells with his piece at one of the Clanchattan cloathed in a yellow
warr coat (which, amongst them, is the badge of the cheifetaines or
heads of clans). And, peircing his body with the bullet, stricks him
to the ground, and retires with gladness into the castle. The man
killed was Angus himselfe, whom his people carry away, and conceill
his death for many years, pretending he was gone beyond seas.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>
</div>

<p>On account of the proximity of the Western Isles of Scotland to the
northern portions of Ireland there was frequent intercourse between
the inhabitants, and aid in seasons of disturbance was a mutual
courtesy. During the last years of the sixteenth century the Red Earl
of Ulster, Hugh O’Donnell, was in arms against the English Crown; and
in 1594 a body of warriors was despatched from the Western Isles to
his assistance. Peregrine O’Clery’s description of these troops, as
translated from the Irish by Edward O’Reilly, is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>These (the auxiliaries from the isles) were afterwards mixed with
the Irish militia, with the diversity of their arms, their armour,
their mode, manners, and speech. The outward clothing they wore was a
mottled garment with numerous colours hanging in folds to the calf of
the leg, with a girdle round the loins over the garment. Some of them
with horn-hafted swords, large and military, over their shoulders.
A man when he had to strike with them was obliged to apply both
his hands to the haft. Others with bows, well polished, strong and
serviceable, with long twanging hempen strings, and sharp-pointed
arrows that whizzed in their flight.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The tartan belted plaid is undoubtedly here described, since no
other garment could have been so disposed as to afford the requisite
protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>In 1596 Sir Duncan Campbell of Glenvrquhay granted in heritage to his
third son,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>John Campbell of Auchinryre, the lands of Auchynrere, Drumnavoke, and
Condolych, respectively of the old extent of six, four, and two marks,
for the yearly payment of £10 Scots at the usual terms, and one gallon
of sufficient aquavite “et optimam chlamidem coloratam, vulgo ane fyne
hewed brakane” [<em>i.e.</em>, breacan or tartan plaid] at Martinmas.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In connection with the plantation of Ulster by Scots colonists towards
the end of the sixteenth century, there is evidence that tartan was
manufactured in Ireland at that period. Concerning Lady Montgomery,
wife of Sir Hugh Montgomery of the Eglinton family, who was a daughter
of the Laird of Greenock, we read:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She set up and encouraged linen and woollen manufactory which soon
brought down the prices of the breakens [<em>i.e.</em>, tartans] and narrow
cloths of both sorts.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Of seventeenth century writings one of the earliest to provide a notice
of the Highland dress is <cite>Camden’s Britannia</cite>, printed in 1607, which
mentions that:-</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>This country is inhabited by a rough, warlike, and very mischievous
sort of people, commonly called Highlandmen, who are the true
offspring of the ancient Scotch, speak Irish, call themselves
Albinnich, are set and tight moulded, of great strength and swiftness,
high spirited, bred up in war or rather robbery, and extremely prone
to revenge and deep resentment. They wear after the Irish fashion
striped mantles and thick long hair, and live by hunting, fishing, and
plunder.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Doubtless there was greater intercourse between the English and their
conquered dependants in Ireland than between the English and the Scots,
and hence the dress in Ireland ranks before that in Scotland in the
comparison instituted by the writer.</p>

<p>Peculiar interest attaches to the description of John Taylor in <cite>The
Pennyless Pilgrimage</cite>; for his observations, carefully noted down in
1618, in view of the fact that they would come under the cognisance
of the king (James VI.), are full and important, as this extract
illustrates:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Thus with extreme travell, ascending and descending, mounting and
alighting, I came at night to the place where I would be, in the Brea
of Marr, which is a large country, all composed of such mountaines,
that Shooter’s hill, Gads hill, Highgate hill, Hampsted hill, Birdlip
hill, or Malvernes hill, are but mole-hills in comparison, or like a
liver, or a gizzard <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>under a capon’s wing, in respect to the altitude
of their tops, or perpendicularitie of their bottomes. There I saw
mount Benawne [Benavon in Braemar] with a furr’d mist upon his snowie
head instead of a night cap: for you must understand, that the oldest
man alive never saw but the snow was on the top of divers of those
hills, both in summer, as well as in winter. There did I finde the
truely noble and right honourable Lords John Erskin Earle of Marr,
James Stuart Earle of Murray, George Gordon Earle of Engye, sonne and
heire to the Marquesse of Huntly, James Erskin Earle of Bughan, and
John Lord Erskin, sonne and heire to the Earle of Marr, and their
Countesses, with my much honoured, and my best assured and approved
friend, Sir William Murray knight, of Abercarny, and hundred of
others knights, esquires, and their followers; all and every man
in generall in one habit, as if Licurgus had beene there, and made
lawes of equality. For once in the yeere, which is the whole moneth
of August, and sometimes part of September, many of the nobility
and gentry of the kingdome (for their pleasure) doe come into these
high-land countries to hunt, where they doe conforme themselves to the
habite of the High-land-men, who for the most part, speake nothing
but Irish; and in former time were those people which were called
the Red-shankes. Their habite is shooes with but one sole apiece;
stockings (which they call short hose) made of a warm stuffe of divers
colours, which they call Tartane: as for breeches, many of them, nor
their forefathers, never wore any, but a jerkin of the same stuffe
that their hose is of, their garters being bands or wreathes of hay or
straw, with a plead about their shoulders, which is a mantle of divers
colours, much finer and lighter stuffe than their hose, with blue
flat caps on their heads, a handkerchiefe knit with two knots about
their necke; and thus are they attyred. Now, their weapons are long
bowes and forked arrowes, swords and targets, harquebusses, muskets,
durks, and Loquhabor-axes. With these armes I found many of them armed
for the hunting. As for their attire, any man of what degree soever
that comes amongst them, must not disdaine to weare it: for if they
doe, then they will disdaine to hunt, or willingly to bring in their
dogges: but if men be kind unto them, and be in their habit; then are
they conquered with kindnesse, and the sport will be plentifull. This
was the reason that I found so many noblemen and gentlemen in those
shapes. But to proceed to the hunting.</p>

<p>My good Lord of Marr having put me into that shape, I rode with him
from his house, where I saw the ruines of an old castle, called the
castle of Kindroghit. It was built by King Malcolm Canmore (for a
hunting house) who raigned in Scotland when Edward the Confessor,
Harold, and Norman William raigned in England: I speak of it, because
it was the last house I saw in those parts; for I was the space
of twelve days after, before I saw either house, corne-field, or
habitation for any creature, but deere, wilde horses, wolves, and
suche like creatures, which made me doubt that I should never have
seene a house againe.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The attachment of the Highlanders to their distinctive attire is
conspicuously evident in this account, which deserves careful study
in consequence of its <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>profusion of detail. Trews (breeches) were
not worn, but in their stead was a tartan “jerkin”; and this had no
connection with the plaid, for the people had a “plead about their
shoulders, which is a mantle of divers colours, much finer and lighter
stuffe than their hose.” Being coarser and thicker than the plaid, the
“jerkin” could scarcely have been the shirt, and it was most probably
the feilebeg, or little kilt, used as a separate garment.</p>

<p>That the form of the feilebeg was known to the Highlanders before the
civil wars of the seventeenth century, and that the belted plaid was
thrown occasionally into the form of the feilebeg, is proved by the
following extract:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As for their Apparel; next the skin, they wear a short linnen Shirt,
which the great Men among them sometimes dye of saffron Colour.
They use it short, that it may not incumber them, when running or
travelling. Major says the common People among them went out to
Battle, having their Body cover’d with Linnen of many Folds sewed
together and done over with Wax or Pitch, with a covering of Hart’s
Skin; but that the English and common lowland Scots fought in Clokes.
In the sharp Winter weather the Highland Men wear close trowzes, which
cover the Thighs, Legs, and Feet. To fence their feet they put on
Rullions or raw leather shoes. Above their Shirt they have a single
Coat, reaching no farther than the Navel. Their uppermost Garment is
a loose Cloke of several Ells, striped and party colour’d (the tartan
plaid), which they gird breadth-wise with a Leathern Belt so as it
scarce covers the knees, and that for the above-mention’d Reason, that
it may be no Lett to them, when on a Journey or doing any Work. Far
the greatest part of the Plaid covers the uppermost parts of the Body.
Sometimes it is all folded round the Body about the Region of the
Belt, for disengaging and leaving the Hands free; and sometimes ’tis
wrapped round all that is above the Flank. The trowzes are for Winter
use; at other Times they content themselves with short Hose, which
scarce reach to the knees. When they compose themselves to Rest and
Sleep, they loose the Belt, and roll themselves in the Plaid, lying
down on the bare Ground, or putting Heather under them nicely set
together after their Manner; or, for want of that, they use a little
Straw or Hay.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It has been already noted that the Scottish auxiliaries who went
to France in 1552 were in trews (“hois”), and, similarly, when the
northern army invaded England in 1639, no reference is made to the kilt
or to the bare legs, the first peculiarity to impress strangers. It
would thus appear that the kilt did not at this time form part of the
military dress. The following description is extracted from Defoe’s
<cite>Memoirs of a Cavalier</cite>, which evinces considerable acquaintance with
military habits and equipments:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I confess, the soldiers made a very uncouth figure, especially the
highlanders: the oddness and barbarity of their garb and arms seemed
to have something in it remarkable. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>They were generally tall swinging
fellows; their swords were extravagantly and I think insignificantly
broad, and they carried great wooden targets, large enough to cover
the upper part of their bodies. Their dress was as antique as the
rest; a cap on their heads, called by them a bonnet, long hanging
sleeves behind, and their doublet, breeches, and stockings, of a stuff
they called plaid, striped across red and yellow, with short cloaks
of the same. These fellows looked, when drawn out, like a regiment
of merry-andrews, ready for Bartholomew Fair. They are in companies
all of a name and therefore call one another only by their christian
names, ... and they scorn to be commanded but by one of their own clan
or family.... There were three or four thousand of these in the Scots’
army, armed only with swords and targets; and in their belts some of
them had a pistol, but no musquets at that time among them.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Here again there appears to be evidence of the plaid, under the
designation of “short cloak,” as a separate garment, which, taken
in conjunction with Taylor’s description in 1618, affords a strong
presumption that its use, along with, but detached from, kilt or trews,
was quite common.</p>

<p>In the act and decreet in favour of Thomas M’Kenzie of Pluscardin
against a band of Highlanders who had plundered him and his tenants
in the month of June 1649, there are enumerated as among the articles
taken away or destroyed:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><cite lang="sco">Item ane whyt plaid worth eight punds With coat and trews and shoes

twentie shilling the elne. Item ten elnes of tartan at threttie
shilling the elne.</cite><a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In 1669 the Rev. James Brome, M.A., Rector of Cheriton in Kent, visited
Scotland, and in 1700 he published his work. His description of
Highland dress and arms is largely adapted from Buchanan, whose work
is, indeed, appropriated by many other writers. Brome’s note is as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <em>Highlanders</em>, who inhabit the West part of the Country, in their
Language Habit and Manners agree much with the Customs of the Wild
<em>Irish</em>, and their chief City is <em>Elgin</em>, in the County of <em>Murray</em>,
seated upon the Water of <em>Lossy</em>, formerly the Bishop of <em>Murray’s</em>
Seat, with a Church sumptuously built, but now gone to decay. They
go habited in Mantles striped, or streaked with divers colours about
their Shoulders, which they call <em>Plodden</em>, with a Coat girt close to
their Bodies, and commonly are naked upon their Legs, but wear Sandals
upon the Soles of their Feet, and their Women go clad much after the
same Fashion: They get their Living mostly by Hunting, Fishing, and
Fowling; and when they go to War, the Armour wherewith they cover
their Bodies, is a Morion or Bonnet of Iron, and an Habergeon, which
comes down almost to their very <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>Heels; their Weapons against their
Enemies are Bows and Arrows, and they are generally reputed good
Marks-Men upon all occasions; their Arrows for the most part are
barbed or crooked, which once entred within the Body cannot well be
drawn out again, unless the Wound be made wider; some of them fight
with broad Swords and Axes, and in the room of a Drum make use of
a Bag-pipe. They delight much in Musick, but chiefly in Harps and
Clarishoes of their own Fashion, the strings of which are made of
Brass-Wire, and the strings of their Harps with Sinews, which strings
they strike either with their Nails growing long, or else with an
Instrument appointed for that use.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Thomas Kirk, of Cookridge, Yorkshire, who made an extensive tour in
Scotland in 1677, kept a journal of his observations, and, thanks to
his minute description, it becomes possible to demonstrate that the
story of the modern invention of the feilebeg or kilt as a separate
article of dress is a fabrication. For not only does he describe the
kilt precisely, but he notes with great exactness the manner of wearing
the plaid, which corresponds in every particular with its use at the
present time. Writing at Inverness, he says:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Here we may note the habit of a Highlander: their doublets are slashed
in the sleeves, and open on the back; their breeches and stockings
are either all on a piece, and straight to them, plaid colour; or
otherwise, a sort of breeches, not unlike a petticoat, that reaches
not so low, by far, as their knees, and their stockings are rolled up
about the calves of their legs, and tied with a garter, their knee
and thigh being naked. On their right side they wear a dagger, about
a foot or half-a-yard long, the back filed like a saw, and several
kinnes (? skeans) struck in the sheath of it; in either pocket a case
of iron or brass pistols, a sword about a handful broad, and five feet
long, on the other side, and perhaps a gun on one shoulder and a sack
of luggage on the other. Thus accoutred, with a plaid over the left
shoulder and under the right arm, and a cap a-cock, he struts like a
peacock, and rather prides in than disdains his speckled feet.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that this testimony, which decides the vexed
question of the separate use of kilt and plaid prior to the eighteenth
century, has hitherto escaped the notice of all writers on the subject.</p>

<p>During the turbulent period of the wars of Montrose and Dundee many
bodies of armed Highlanders were imported into the Lowlands. One of
the largest, known as the Highland Host, consisted of ten thousand
men employed in the repression of the Western Shires. A letter in the
Wodrow MSS., Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh, written under date 1st
February 1678, states:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We are now all quartered in and about this town [? Ayr], the
Highlanders only in free quarters. It would be truely a pleasant
sight, were it at an ordinary weaponshaw, to see this Highland crew.
You know the fashion of their wild apparel, not one of ten of them
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>hath breaches, yet hose and shoes are their greatest need and most
clever prey, and they spare not to take them every where: In so much
that the committee here, and the Counsel with you (as it is said) have
ordered some thousands of pairs of shoes to be made to stanch this
great spoil. As for their armes and other militarie acoutrements,
it is not possible for me to describe them in writing; here you may
see head-pieces and steel-bonnets raised like pyramides, and such as
a man would affirme they had only found in chamber-boxes; targets
and shields of the most odde and anticque forme, and pouder hornes
hung in strings, garnished with beaten nails and plates of burnished
brass. And truely I doubt not but a man, curious in our antiquities,
might in this host finde explications of the strange pieces of
armour mentioned in our old lawes, such as bosnet, iron-hat, gorget,
pesane, wambrassers, and reerbrassers, panns, leg-splents, and the
like, above what any occasion in the Lowlands would have afforded for
several hundereds of yeers. Among their ensignes also, besides other
singularities, the Glencow men were very remarkable, who had for their
ensigne a faire bush of heath, wel-spred and displayed on the head of
a staff, such as might have affrighted a Roman eagle.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This letter is especially noteworthy as containing an early reference
to the badge or ensign used to distinguish particular clans. The
“Glencow” men—no doubt the Mac Ians of Glencoe, a sept of the Clan
Mac Donald—“had for their ensign a fair bush of heath,” and the badge
of the Mac Donalds is still Fraoch or heath. The writer’s description
implies that the rank and file of the Highland Host wore the kilt or
the belted plaid; those who did not being, of course, the officers,
who would wear the trews. That such was the fact is confirmed by what
follows.</p>

<p>A sarcastic and amusing description of the Highlanders concerned in
the expedition of 1678 was written by Lieut.-Colonel William Cleland
(1661-1689), of the Cameronian or Earl of Angus’s Regiment, who was
killed fighting the remnant of Viscount Dundee’s army. Not only does
it confirm the description in the Wodrow letter, but it furnishes
information of a detailed character as to dress and accoutrements, as
the following quotation shows:—</p>

<p>Here we have two distinct forms of dress—that of the men, the kilt or
the belted plaid, and that of the “chief Commanders,” who “were right
well mounted of their gear; with brogues, trues, and pirnie plaides.”</p>

<p>But perhaps the most striking evidence that two forms of dress were in
use in the Highlands at this time is that supplied by the supporters of
the arms of Skene of that Ilk. The blazon of the supporters in the Lyon
Register is:—</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_032">
<img src="images/i_032.jpg" alt="forms of dress for men" width="448" height="350">
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>On the dexter by a highland man in his proper garb holding a skene
with his right hand in a guarding posture, and on the sinister be
another in a servill habit his target on the left arm and the darlach
by his side.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>In the Introduction to the <cite>Nisbet Plates</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> the work from which the
illustration is taken, it is pointed out that in the Nisbet MS. the
description of the supporters runs as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Supported on the dexter by a highland gentleman in his proper garb,
holding a skein with his right hand in a guarding posture, and on the
sinister by another highlandman in a servill habit, with his target on
his left arme and his dorloch be his side.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is impossible to conceive of evidence of a more conclusive and
satisfactory character than that here adduced of the existence of
both modes of dress at this period and of the rank of the respective
wearers. The original illustration is the work of Robert Wood, an
Edinburgh engraver, and in Mr Ross’s Opinion was executed, and
Alexander Nisbet’s description above quoted written, 1695-1704.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><cite>The Grameid</cite>, written in 1691, contains many references to the
clothing and uniforms of the Highland army serving under Viscount
Dundee. From the shoulder of Keppoch “hung the tartan plaid.” The
inhabitants of the Hebrides are clothed “in yellow and blue.” Dundee,
addressing the leaders, bids them “draw out your clans in their
saffron array upon the plain,” and speaks of “the plaided race of
Grampian giants.” General Mackay is represented as concluding “that
he had subdued the tartaned bands of ancient Albion.” A most explicit
description is that of the followers of Glengarry, “three hundred
illustrious youths in the first flower of vigorous manhood, each of
whom a tartan garb covers, woven with Phrygian skill in triple stripe,
and as a garment clothes their broad chests and flanks. A helmet
defends the temples of the men. A coloured plaid veils their shoulders,
and otherwise they are naked.... Following him closely comes his
brother Allan, the brave, with a hundred men all clothed in garments
interwoven with the red stripe, their brawny calves bound with the
red buskin.” Of Locheil, the poet says, “his tartan hose are gartered
round his calf.” M’Martin in “variegated array advances with lofty
mien”; the garter ribbons “hanging at his leg were dyed with Corycian
saffron, and with the tint of the Tyrian shell, as was his plaid.” Of
Mac Lean of Duart and his brother Alexander “the flowing plaid with
yellow stripe covers the shoulders of both the brothers.” Mac Neill of
Barra “displays as many colours woven into his plaid as the rainbow in
the clouds shows in the sunlight.” The Mac Leods of <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>Raasay advance
“with plumed heads erect, and shoulders covered with girded plaid.” The
Dougals of Craignish “all carry the brazen-hilted sword, and wear the
girded plaid.” “The whole plaided forces of the Highland chiefs, both
horse and foot, the entire body take post.” Dundee beholds his “bands
gleaming with brass, and admires the companies in their brilliant
colours, and is refreshed by the sharp note of the pipe.” The “tartaned
host” pours itself out upon the field. In sight of their opponents the
Highland warriors “draw their swords, and, extended on the plain, they
move in ordered ranks; they cast their brogues of bull’s hide, and make
a pile of their plaids, and thus stripped, prepare for the battle.”
General Mackay takes counsel how he “will overwhelm the tartaned lines
of the target-bearing Scot”; while the poet writes of the march of
his opponents, “the whole body of the Highlanders is formed into one
column, and forthwith the cavalry mount their horses, and the whole
plaided army, with floating banners, went forth from the deserted camp
into the open plain.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>It appears from various references that the trews and the belted plaid
were sometimes worn together. On a powder-horn which belonged to the
late James Drummond, R.S.A., and now in the Museum of the Society of
Antiquaries in Edinburgh, there are figures in the Highland dress,
and one of these seems to illustrate this mode. As to the age of the
relic, Mr Drummond, in a communication to the Society in April 1872,
gave various reasons for believing it to have been the property of Sir
George Mackenzie of Tarbat, who was born in 1630. Again, in an extract
from a MS. stated to have been in the possession of Dr. Mac Lean, Oban,
giving an account of the battle of Killiecrankie, it is stated that
John Macrae of Inversheil, having been struck in the thigh by a musket
shot—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The ball having carried into the wound the cloth of his belted plade,
and the trewes that he wore under them, the woolen did so wrankle the
flesh, that with his hard travail, and need of a chirurgeon, it was
long after before he got cured.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In fact, so late as 1746, when Prince Charles Edward embarked on his
return to France, a letter written by Colonel Warren, and preserved
among the Stuart papers, records that he was dressed in “a threadbare
coat of coarse black frieze, tartan trews, and over them a belted
plaid.”</p>

<p>In 1688 William Sacheverell, Governor of the Isle of Man, visited Mull
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>and other Western Islands, and his account is valuable and interesting
because it is fair in its criticism and accurate in its description;
and it affords evidence of the general use of the belted plaid, to
the exclusion of the trews, among the common people. Sacheverell
superintended the efforts made to recover the guns and other fittings
of the <em>Florida</em>, one of the scattered vessels of the Spanish Armada,
blown up, according to the traditions of the Mac Leans, by Donald Glas,
son of Mac Lean of Morvern, in Tobermory Bay in 1588. Thus he had ample
opportunity of noting the costume and manners of the natives of Mull
and other Highlanders, of whom he writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>During my stay I generally observed the men to be large-bodied,
stout, subtle, active, patient of cold and hunger. There appeared in
all their actions a certain generous air of freedom, and contempt of
those trifles, luxury and ambition, which we so servilely creep after.
They bound their appetites by their necessities, and their happiness
consists, not in having much, but in coveting little. The women seem
to have the same sentiments with the men; though their habits were
mean and they had not our sort of breeding, yet in many of them there
was a natural beauty and a graceful modesty, which never fails of
attracting. The usual habit of both sexes is the pladd; the women’s
much finer, the colours more lively, and the squares larger than the
men’s, and put me in mind of the ancient Picts. This serves them for
a veil, and covers both head and body. The men wear theirs after
another manner; especially when designed for ornament, it is loose and
flowing, like the mantles our painters give their heroes. Their thighs
are bare, with brawny muscles. Nature has drawn all her strokes bold
and masterly; what is covered is only adapted to necessity; a thin
brogue on the foot, a short buskin of various colours on the legg,
tied above the calf with a striped pair of garters. What should be
concealed is hid with a large shot-pouch, on each side of which hangs
a pistol and a dagger; as if they found it necessary to keep those
parts well guarded. A round target on their backs, a blew bonnet on
their heads, in one hand a broadsword, and a musquet in the other,
perhaps no nation goes better armed; and I assure you they will handle
them with bravery and dexterity, especially the sword and target, as
our veteran regiments found to their cost at Gille Crankee.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the closing years of the seventeenth century the Western Isles of
Scotland were visited by a traveller, who has left the most complete
account of the people and their manner of life which had been written
up to that date. The author, Martin, undertook the journey with the
specific purpose of recording particulars concerning the people; and,
as his work evinces careful observation, reliance may be placed on his
description of their dress at the time of his visit. It supplies the
first indication, in any book of travel, of the use of special colours
or setts for tartans used in different localities.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>The first Habit wore by Persons of Distinction in the Islands, was the
<em>Leni-Croich</em>, from the <em>Irish</em> word <em>Leni</em>, which signifies a Shirt,
and <em>Croich</em> Saffron, because their Shirt was dyed with that Herb: the
ordinary number of Ells us’d to make this Robe, was twenty four; it
was the upper Garb, reaching below the Knees, and was tied with a Belt
round the middle: but the Islanders have laid it aside about a hundred
Years ago.</p>

<p>They now generally use Coat, Wastcoat, and Breeches, as elsewhere;
and on their Heads wear Bonnets made of thick Cloth, some blue, some
black, and some grey.</p>

<p>Many of the People wear <em>Trowis</em>: some have them very fine woven
like Stockings of those made of Cloth; some are colour’d, and others
striped: the latter are as well shap’d as the former, lying close
to the Body from the middle downwards, and tied round with a Belt
above the Haunches. There is a square Piece of Cloth which hangs down
before. The Measure for shaping the <em>Trowis</em> is a Stick of Wood, whose
Length is a Cubit, and that divided into the Length of a Finger, and
half a Finger; so that it requires more Skill to make it than the
ordinary Habit.</p>

<p>The Shoes antiently wore, were a piece of the Hide of a Deer, Cow, or
Horse, with the Hair on, being tied behind and before with a Point of
Leather. The generality now wear Shoes, having one thin Sole only, and
shaped after the right and left Foot; so that what is for one Foot,
will not serve the other.</p>

<p>But Persons of Distinction wear the Garb in Fashion in the South of
<em>Scotland</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Plad</em> wore only by the Men, is made of fine Wool, the Thred as
fine as can be made of that kind; it consists of divers Colours, and
there is a great deal of Ingenuity requir’d in sorting the Colours, so
as to be agreeable to the nicest Fancy. For this reason the Women are
at great pains, first to give an exact Pattern of the <em>Plad</em> upon a
piece of Wood, having the number of every Thred of the Stripe on it.
The Length of it is commonly seven double Ells; the one end hangs by
the Middle over the left Arm, the other going round the Body, hangs by
the end over the left Arm also; the right Hand above it is to be at
liberty to do any thing upon occasion. Every Isle differs from each
other in their Fancy of making <em>Plads</em>, as to the Stripes in Breadth,
and Colours. This Humour is as different thro the main Land of the
<em>Highlands</em>, in-so-far that they who have seen those Places, are
able, at the first View of a Man’s <em>Plad</em>, to guess the Place of his
Residence.</p>

<p>When they travel on foot, the <em>Plad</em> is tied on the Breast with a
Bodkin of Bone or Wood (just as the <em>Spina</em> wore by the <em>Germans</em>,
according to the Description of <em>C. Tacitus</em>:) the <em>Plad</em> is tied
round the middle with a Leather Belt; it is pleated from the Belt to
the Knee very nicely: this Dress for Footmen is found much easier and
lighter than <em>Breeches</em>, or <em>Trowis</em>.</p>

<p>The antient Dress wore by the Women, and which is yet wore by some of
the Vulgar, called <em>Arisad</em>, is a white <em>Plad</em>, having a few small
Stripes of black, blue, and red; it reach’d from the Neck to the
Heels, and was tied before on the Breast with a Buckle of Silver, or
Brass, according to the Quality of the Person. I have seen some of the
former of an hundred Marks value; it was broad as any ordinary Pewter
Plate, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span> curiously engraven with various Animals, <em>&amp;c.</em> There
was a lesser Buckle, which was wore in the middle of the larger,
and above two Ounces weight; it had in the Center a large piece of
Chrystal, or some finer Stone, and this was set all round with several
finer Stones of a lesser size.</p>

<p>The <em>Plad</em> being pleated all round, was tied with a Belt below
the Breast; the Belt was of Leather, and several Pieces of Silver
intermix’d with the Leather like a Chain. The lower end of the Belt
has a Piece of Plate about eight Inches long, and three in breadth,
curiously engraven; the end of which was adorned with fine Stones, or
Pieces of Red Coral. They wore Sleeves of Scarlet Cloth, clos’d at the
end as Mens Vests, with Gold Lace round ’em, having Plate Buttons set
with fine Stones. The Head-dress was a fine <em>Kerchief</em> of Linen strait
about the Head, hanging down the Back taper-wise; a large Lock of Hair
hangs down their Cheeks above their Breast, the lower end tied with a
Knot of Ribbands....</p>

<p>The antient way of Fighting was by set Battles; and for Arms some had
broad two-handed Swords and Head-pieces, and others Bows and Arrows.
When all their Arrows were spent, they attack’d one another with Sword
in hand. Since the Invention of Guns, they are very early accustomed
to use them, and carry their Pieces with them where-ever they go:
They likewise learn to handle the broad Sword and Target. The <em>Chief</em>
of each Tribe advances with his Followers within shot of the Enemy,
having first laid aside their upper Garments; and after one general
Discharge, they attack them with Sword in hand, having their Target on
their left Hand (as they did at <em>Kelicranky</em>) which soon brings the
Matter to an Issue, and verifies the Observation made of ’em [by] your
Historians:</p>

<p>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aut Mors cito, aut Victoria læta</i>.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Certainly this is evidence of the employment of fixed designs and
special colours in the tartans, as well by the Islanders as by the
Highlanders of the mainland; and many have held it to settle the
question of their use as clan distinctions at that period. At all
events, it shows that district tartans were in use in Martin’s day, and
that their colourings furnished an indication of the localities whence
the wearers came.</p>

<p>It is out of the question to suppose that the tartans described by
Martin sprang into being in his day. On the contrary, all the evidence
we possess—proving, as it does, the extremely conservative character
of the inhabitants of the Western Islands—points to the conclusion
that Martin was the witness, at the end of the seventeenth century, of
habits and customs in use long previously.</p>

<p>Of the existence of a uniform clan pattern at the very commencement of
the eighteenth century there is a complete chain of evidence. Captain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>Hamilton writes from Inverness, 23rd July 1703, to Brigadier-General
Maitland, Governor of Fort-William:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I wrote to you Tuesday last in answer to your last letter to me, but
I neglected to acquaint you of our news here. The thing is there is a
match of Hunting to be as is said against 2nd of next month amongst
several of our great folks, particularly the Duke of Hamilton is to be
there, the Marquis of Athole, and our neighbour the Laird of Grant,
who has ordered 600 of his men in arms, in good order, with Tartane
Coats all of one colour and fashion. This is his order to his people
in Straithspey. If it be a match at Hunting only I know not, but I
think it my duty to acquaint you, whatever may fall out, of any such
body of men in arms, particularly in our Northern Parts.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The following entries in the Court Books of the Regality of Grant,
1703-1710, are given in full, because they are of the utmost
importance, and have never hitherto been accurately quoted. Among

</div>

<p>A very curious and somewhat puzzling state of affairs is disclosed
by a minute examination of the fine series of family portraits
preserved at Castle Grant.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Of these portraits no fewer than ten
were painted by Richard Waitt, namely, Brigadier Grant of Grant and
Donald Grant of Glenbeg, in 1713; Patrick Grant of Miltown, Mungo Grant
of Mulloch-hard, —— Grant of Delbuaick, David Grant of Delbuaick,
Patrick Grant of Tullochgriban, Alister Grant “Mohr,” and the Piper
to the Laird of Grant, in 1714; and John Grant of Burnside, in 1725.
Besides these, Waitt painted other Grant portraits in tartan attire. By
permission of the Countess of Seafield, coloured drawings of these have
been made, and comparison discovers a variety of design well-nigh as
great as would be the case in an equal number of examples selected at
random from as many different families. In one particular alone do they
agree, and that is in the absence of any completely dark-coloured sett,
such as is usually designated “uaine” or green. It is not till after
the ’45 that there is an instance of any member of the clan wearing
the so-called undress Grant tartan, now the familiar “Forty-Second” or
Black Watch pattern.</p>

<p>Similar remarks might be made concerning other family portraits. For
example, in the Mac Donald portraits at Armadale there are at least six
distinct setts of tartan. The Campbell portraits at Loudoun Castle and
Langton House exhibit equal diversity, while differing at the same time
from any of the Campbell setts at present in use. In the same way the
pictures of the Sutherland family at Dunrobin and Barrogill, the Mac
Donell portraits at Balgownie, the Mac Leod at Dunvegan, the Drummond
at Gordon Castle and Drummond Castle, the Macpherson at Cluny, the
Frasers in Inverness-shire, show remarkable variety of arrangement and
colouring. Whatever the reason of this, it assuredly did not arise from
carelessness or ignorance on the part of the artists employed. On the
contrary, in the great majority of the pictures referred to, painful
attention has been paid to minuteness and accuracy in details of the
dress, and the sett of a tartan is reproduced in <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>different portions of
the costume with a faithfulness which leaves no room for doubt that the
artists were studiously copying distinct patterns.</p>

<p>The importance of the tartan manufacture to Scotland in the beginning
of the eighteenth century is evident from the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In this place it’s proper to mention their Plaids, a Manufacture
wherein they exceed all Nations, both as to Colour and Fineness.
They have of late been pretty much fancy’d in England, and are very
ornamental as well as durable for Beds, Hangings, Window-Curtains
and Night-Gowns for Men and Women; so that Attempts have been made
in England to resemble them, at Norwich and elsewhere, but they fall
much short both in Colour, Fineness, and Workmanship, as is evident
at first sight. A good improvement may be made of this manufacture
for domestick use and export, now that the prohibition is remov’d by
the Union. The stronger sort of those Plaids is the usual Cloathing
for their Men in the Highlands, where they never alter the form of
their Habit, which, to other People, seems uncouth, because not us’d
elsewhere; yet it must be own’d, that as they are us’d by those of the
better sort in the Highlands, they make a manly as well as a decent
Habit.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>In <cite>A Journey through Scotland</cite>, undertaken between 1716 and 1723,
occurs this description of the cattle fair at Crieff and of the dress
of the Highland gentlemen and their followers, which confirms in all
particulars the other accounts of the use of tartan at the period, and
the distinction between the dress of the upper and lower orders:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Highland Fair of Criff happening when I was at Stirling, I had the
Curiosity to go see it. There were at least Thirty Thousand Cattle
sold there, most of them to English Drovers; who paid down above
Thirty Thousand Guineas in ready Money to the Highlanders; a Sum they
had never seen before, and proves one good Effect of the Union. The
Highland Gentlemen were mighty civil, dress’d in their slash’d short
Wastcoats, a Trousing, (which is, Breeches and Stockings of one Piece
of strip’d Stuff) with a Plaid for a Cloak, and a blue Bonnet. They
have a Ponyard Knife and Fork in one Sheath, hanging at one side of
their Belt, their Pistol at the other, and their Snuff-Mill before;
with a great broad Sword by their side. Their Attendance [attendants]
were very numerous, all in belted Plaids, girt like Womens Petticoats
down to the Knee; their Thighs and Half of the Leg all bare. They
had also each their broad Sword and Ponyard, and spake all Irish, an
unintelligible Language to the English.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>It appears from the regulations issued to the retainers of the Clan
Grant anent the wearing of a uniform tartan that distinctive patterns
were in use, at least for military purposes, or on occasions of great
gatherings, early in the eighteenth century. That widespread attention
was at that period <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>bestowed upon particular arrangements of tartan
appears from a letter quoted by Sir Walter Scott, dated from the Manse
of Comrie, 2nd July 1717:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I give your lady hearty thanks for the highland plaid. Its good cloath
but it does not answer the sett I sent some time agoe with M<sup>c</sup>Arthur.</p>
</div>

<p>This implies, at the least, in a district on the southern border of the
Highlands, adhesion to particular patterns, just as in Martin’s account
of the Western Islands, already quoted, the existence of district setts
is proved by the use of the words “able, at the first view of a man’s
plad, to guess the place of his residence.”</p>

<p>Alexander Nisbet, the great herald, referring to the supporters of
Macpherson of Cluny, writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The family has been in use to have their arms supported with two
Highland men with steel helmets on their heads and cut out short
doublets azure, thighs bare, their shirts tied between them, and round
targets on their arms, being the dress wherein those of this clan were
wont to fight in many battles for the crown being always loyal.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>
</div>

<p>That the dress thus described by Nisbet was intended by him to
represent what we know to be the usual dress of the Highlanders at
that period, viz., the belted plaid, is proved by another allusion
of his to the Cluny arms in a portion of his work not yet published,
and preserved in the Lyon Office, in which, treating generally of
supporters, he writes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>M<sup>c</sup>Pherson of Clunie two highlandmen in their belted plaids with
targets.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>
</div>

<p>An almost contemporary example of the peculiar mode of wearing the
dress, described as “shirts tied,” is to be found in the portrait of
Sir Stuart Threipland of Fingask, by Delacour, painted about this
period.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Without exception the most complete description of the Highlands
and the dress worn there, written during the eighteenth century, is
that given by Burt. The account has been frequently the subject of
criticism, but it is now generally accepted as presenting a faithful
picture of the state of the country at the period to which it relates.
As it traverses a wide field, a lengthened extract is given, for the
purpose of comparison with earlier descriptions of the costume and
manners of the people already quoted:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The plaid is the undress of the ladies [writing of Inverness]; and to
a genteel <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>woman, who adjusts it with a good air, is a becoming veil.
But as I am pretty sure you never saw one of them in England, I shall
employ a few words to describe it to you. It is made of silk or fine
worsted, chequered with various lively colours, two breadths wide,
and three yards in length; it is brought over the head, and may hide
or discover the face according to the wearer’s fancy or occasion; it
reaches to the waist behind; one corner falls as low as the ankle on
one side; and the other part, in folds, hangs down from the opposite
arm.</p>

<p>I have been told, in Edinburgh, that the ladies distinguish their
political principles, whether Whig or Tory, by the manner of wearing
their plaids;—that is, one of the parties reverses the old fashion,
but which of them it is, I do not remember, nor is it material.</p>

<p>As I was travelling in a very wild part of the country, and
approaching the house of one of those gentlemen, who had notice of
my coming, he met me at some distance from his dwelling, with his
Arcadian offering of milk and cream, as usual, carried before him by
his servants. He afterwards invited me to his hut, which was built
like the others, only very long, but without any partition, where
the family was at one end, and some cattle at the other. By the way
(although the weather was not warm), he was without shoes, stockings,
or breeches, in a short coat, with a shirt not much longer, which hung
between his thighs, and just hid his nakedness from two daughters,
about seventeen or eighteen years old, who sat over against him. After
some compliments on either side, and his wishing me <em>good weather</em>, we
entered into conversation, in which he seemed to be a man of as good
sense as he was well-proportioned. In speaking of the country, he told
me he knew I wondered how any body would undergo the inconveniences of
a Highland life.</p>

<p>The Highland dress consists of a bonnet made of thrum without a
brim, a short coat, a waistcoat, longer by five or six inches, short
stockings, and brogues, or pumps without heels. By the way, they cut
holes in their brogues, though new made, to let out the water, when
they have far to go and rivers to pass: this they do to preserve their
feet from galling.</p>

<p>Few besides gentlemen wear the <em>trowze</em>,—that is, the breeches and
stockings all of one piece, and drawn on together; over this habit
they wear a plaid, which is usually three yards long and two breadths
wide, and the whole garb is made of chequered tartan, or plaiding:
this, with the sword and pistol, is called a <em>full dress</em>, and, to a
well-proportioned man, with any tolerable air, it makes an agreeable
figure; but this you have seen in London, and it is chiefly their
mode of dressing when they are in the Lowlands, or when they make a
neighbouring visit, or go anywhere on horseback; but when those among
them who travel on foot, and have not attendants to carry them over
the waters, they vary it into the <em>quelt</em> [kilt], which is a manner I
am about to describe.</p>

<p>The common habit of the ordinary Highlanders is far from being
acceptable to the eye: with them a small part of the plaid, which
is not so large as the former, is set in folds and girt round the
waist, to make of it a short petticoat that reaches half way down
the thigh, and the rest is brought over the shoulders, and then
fastened before, below the neck, often with a fork, and sometimes
with a bodkin or sharpened piece of stick, so that they make pretty
nearly the appearance of the poor women in London when they bring
their gowns over their heads to shelter them from the rain. In this
way of wearing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span> plaid, they have sometimes nothing else to cover
them, and are often barefoot; but some I have seen shod with a kind
of pumps, made out of a raw cow-hide, with the hair turned outward,
which being ill made, the wearer’s foot looked something like those
of a rough-footed hen or pigeon: these are called <em>quarrants</em>, and
are not only offensive to the sight, but intolerable to the smell of
those who are near them. The stocking rises no higher than the thick
of the calf, and from the middle of the thigh to the middle of the leg
is a naked space, which, being exposed to all weathers, becomes tanned
and freckled, and the joint being mostly infected with the country
distemper, the whole is very disagreeable to the eye. This dress is
called the <em>quelt</em>; and, for the most part, they wear the petticoat
so very short, that in a windy day, going up a hill, or stooping, the
indecency of it is plainly discovered....</p>

<p>Various reasons are given both for and against the Highland dress. It
is urged against it, that it distinguishes the natives as a body of
people distinct and separate from the rest of the subjects of Great
Britain, and thereby is one cause of their narrow adherence among
themselves, to the exclusion of all the rest of the kingdom; but
the part of the habit chiefly objected to is the plaid (or mantle),
which, they say, is calculated for the encouragement of an idle life,
in lying about upon the heath, in the day-time, instead of following
some lawful employment; that it serves to cover them in the night
when they lie in wait among the mountains, to commit their robberies
and depredations; and is composed of such colours as altogether, in
the mass, so nearly resemble the heath on which they lie, that it is
hardly to be distinguished from it until one is so near them as to be
within their power, if they have any evil intention; that it renders
them ready, at a moment’s warning, to join in any rebellion, as they
carry continually their tents about them: and, lastly, it was thought
necessary, in Ireland, to suppress that habit by act of parliament,
for the above reasons, and no complaint for the want of it now remains
among the mountaineers of that country.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is alleged, the dress is most convenient to
those who, with no ill design, are obliged to travel from one part
to another upon their lawful occasions, viz.—That they would not be
so free to skip over the rocks and bogs with breeches as they are in
the short petticoat; that it would be greatly incommodious to those
who are frequently to wade through waters, to wear breeches, which
must be taken off upon every such occurrence, or would not only gall
the wearer, but render it very unhealthful and dangerous to their
limbs, to be constantly wet in that part of the body, especially in
winter-time, when they might be frozen: and with respect to the plaid
in particular, the distance between one place of shelter and another,
is often too great to be reached before night comes on; and, being
intercepted by sudden floods, or hindered by other impediments, they
are frequently obliged to lie all night in the hills, in which case
they must perish, were it not for the covering they carry with them.
That even if they should be so fortunate as to reach some hospitable
hut, they must lie upon the ground uncovered, there being nothing to
be spared from the family for that purpose.</p>

<p>And to conclude, a few shillings will buy this dress for an ordinary
Highlander, who, very probably, might hardly ever be in condition to
purchase a Lowland suit, though of the coarsest cloth or stuff, fit to
keep him warm in that cold climate.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I shall determine nothing in this dispute, but leave you to judge
which of these two reasonings is the most cogent.</p>

<p>The whole people are fond and tenacious of the Highland clothing, as
you may believe by what is here to follow.</p>

<p>Being, in a wet season, upon one of my peregrinations, accompanied
by a Highland gentleman, who was one of the clan through which I was
passing, I observed the women to be in great anger with him about
something that I did not understand: at length, I asked him wherein
he had offended them? Upon this question he laughed, and told me his
great-coat was the cause of their wrath; and that their reproach was
that he could not be contented with the garb of his ancestors, but was
degenerated into a Lowlander, and condescended to follow their unmanly
fashions.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To the edition of the <em>Letters</em> from which the above is quoted the
editor appended some notes on the Highland dress, which, though open to
criticism on many points, are sufficiently interesting to justify their
insertion here:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The chequered stuff, commonly worn by the Highlanders, by them called
<em>breacan</em> (<em>parti-coloured</em>), and by the Lowlanders <em>tartan</em> (Fr.
<em>tiretaine</em>), is neither peculiar to Celts nor Goths, and is to be
found, at this day, although not in such general use, among many of
the Sclavonic tribes, who have no connection with either. The wife
of every Russian boor, in the north-western provinces at least, who
can make her such a present at her marriage (and it is often a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine
quâ non</i>), has a <em>tartan plaid</em>, which she wears just as the Scotish
women, in our author’s time, did theirs: it is of massy silk, richly
varied, with broad cross-bars of gold and silver tissue, and makes a
very splendid appearance.</p>

<p>That the Lowlanders had their <em>tartan</em> from the <em>French</em>, at a time
when it was fashionable in other countries, may be presumed from
the <em>name</em>; and to imagine that the manufacture began among the
Highlanders would be ridiculous.</p>

<p>The Highland <em>field-dress</em> of the men was of a coarser texture, and
thickened by fulling; it was called <em>cadda</em> (<em>cath da’</em>, the war
colour), and was a <em>tartan</em> of such colours as were least likely to
betray the wearer, among the woods and heaths, either to the game he
was in quest of, or to his enemies. The dyes were mostly extracted
from woad, when it could be got, and from heath-tops, the bark and
tender twigs of the alder, and other vegetable substances. As to
the ancient <em>form</em> of the dress, nothing could be more simple: the
<em>gentlemen</em>, having less frequent occasion to use their <em>full suit</em>
as a <em>blanket</em>, wore a yellow shirt, a vest, trowsers, and mantle, of
the same fashion as their neighbours. In Ireland, a few centuries ago,
the <em>lower class</em> seldom encumbered themselves with dress of any kind
within doors; and there is every reason to suppose that this was also
the case among their brethren in Scotland. When they went out, they
threw a light blanket round their shoulders, the upper part made tight
with skewers, and the lower gathered up into folds, which they secured
under the girdle, from which the sword, dagger, purse, &amp;c., were
suspended; this they called <em>feile</em>, a word of the same origin with
the Scotish <em>fell</em>, English, <em>peel</em>; Old English, <em>pilche</em>; German
and Northern, <em>peltz</em>, <em>pels</em>, &amp;c.; and the Latin, <em>pellis</em>, all
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>which signified an <em>external surface</em>, <em>skin</em>, or <em>covering</em> of any
kind. <em>Skins</em>, in the modern acceptation of the term, were, no doubt,
the first <em>covering</em>; and the name was afterwards properly enough
applied to a covering of cloth. At night they took out the skewers,
unbuckled the girdle, and reduced the <em>feile</em> to its primary form of
a blanket, to sleep in. The women wore a petticoat, or trowsers, of
skin, cloth, or what they could get, and a cloth thrown round their
bodies when they went out. As civilization advanced, a shirt, with a
tunic, or short jacket, was introduced; the plaits of the <em>feile</em> were
rendered permanent by sewing, and the <em>plaid</em>, to be used either as a
mantle or blanket, was added. The <em>kilt</em>, <em>feilebeg</em> (<em>little feile</em>),
or petticoat, now worn, has succeeded to the folded-up ends of the
original blanket; <em>it is all that remains of the ancient costume</em>, and
was reduced to its present form some time in the beginning of the last
century. The <em>bonnet</em>, or flat, blue thrum cap, is of a very modern
date, and was introduced from the Lowlands. The gentlemen of the
Highlands wore such hats and caps as were worn by gentlemen of their
times in neighbouring countries; and, in the days of our grandfathers,
the lower class of Highlanders were, by their Lowland neighbours (in
the north-east Lowlands, at least), denominated <em>humblies</em>, from their
wearing no covering on their head but their hair, which, at a more
early period, they probably matted and felted, for horror and defence,
as the Irish did in Queen Elizabeth’s time. The helmet-looking bonnet,
now worn, was introduced within the memory of persons still living.</p>

<p>From this simple account of the Highland dress, it will be seen that
it has in itself nothing peculiar to one country more than another; as
the different improvements upon the manner of girding the loins, and
trussing up a blanket, can hardly be called a <em>national costume</em>. The
dress of the Romans began in the same manner, and went through nearly
the same varieties of form; but, for a long time after the Romans
left Britain, it can hardly be imagined, that the inhabitants of the
more remote Highlands had either wool or cloth of their own produce.
Scattered as their sheep, if they had any, must have been upon the
mountains, they had no means of protecting them from the wolves; and
they had not then patient industry enough to look after tame animals
that could not take care of themselves.</p>

<p>The names of the different parts of this dress are all conformable
to what has been said above. The <em>feilebeg</em> is, by the Lowlanders,
called a <em>kilt</em>, from its having been <em>kilted</em>, <em>quilted</em>, or <em>trussed
up</em> under the girdle. The meaning of the Latin <em>toga</em> is found in the
Gaëlic <em>toga’</em>; in English, to <em>tuck up</em>, from the same circumstance;
and a square <em>body-cloth</em>, still worn round the shoulders by the
Highland women, is called a <em>tunic</em>, or <em>tonnac</em>. <em>Plaid</em> (which is
always misapplied in England), in its primary sense, means simply
any thing <em>broad and flat</em>, and thence, a <em>broad, unformed piece of
cloth</em>, and, in its secondary and modern acceptation, a <em>blanket</em>;
in which last import alone it is now used by the Highlanders. The
<em>trews</em>, or trowsers, formerly worn only by the gentry, and by
the lower classes, after the <em>philibeg</em> was proscribed by act of
parliament, are so denominated, from the Gaëlic <em>trusa’</em>, to <em>truss
up</em>, as they supplied the place of the end of the <em>feile</em> which was
<em>trussed</em> under the girdle.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>
<p>During the period following the Union of the Kingdoms of Scotland and
England (1707), tartan plaids were worn in the Lowlands by all classes.
The significance of this universal display of a simple article of dress
consisted in the fact that its wear was regarded as a sort of sumptuary
protest against the Union and the surrender of Scottish independence.
Certain it is that up to the prohibition of the use of tartans and of
the Highland dress by the Act of 1747 the tartan plaid continued in
general use throughout Scotland. Many references to the prevalence of
the habit in the Lowlands as well as in the Highlands might be quoted.
One interesting contribution is that of Ramsay of Ochtertyre, who,
writing in 1795 of the congregation of the Rev. John Skinner’s church
at Linshart, in Buchan, observes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In point of mode and plainness their dress reminded me of that of our
country-people more than forty years ago, bonnets and parti-coloured
plaids being frequent.... In those days every lady in an undress wore
a plaid when she went abroad. It was sometimes of one colour, scarlet,
crimson, &amp;c., but more commonly tartan or variegated. People fond of
finery had silk ones, others wore woollen lined with silk; whilst the
lower classes were satisfied with plain worsted.... In 1747, when I
first knew Edinburgh, nine-tenths of the ladies still wore plaids,
especially at church. By this time, however, silk or velvet cloaks of
one form or another were much in request among people of fashion. And
so rapidly did the plaid wear out, that when I returned to Edinburgh
in 1752 one could hardly see a lady in that piece of dress.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Of the extensive manufacture of tartans in Scotland during the
eighteenth century some evidence may be obtained from a reference to
the newspapers of the period. For example:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Last Saturday the <em>Agatha and Jane</em>, Thomas Christie [master] cleared
out from Leith for London, having on board the following Scots
manufactures, viz., 53,381 yards of Linen, 3006 yards of Tartans.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Leith, Feb. 18.—<cite>The Edinburgh Merchant</cite>, John Dick, cleared out for
London with the following Scots manufactures, viz., 41,400 yards of
Linen, 6400 yards of Tartan.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the same newspaper, and side by side with the orders issued by
Prince Charles Edward, then at Holyrood, appears the following:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Gairdner and Taylor, in their Warehouse at the Sign of the Golden
Key, opposite to Forrester’s Wynd, Lawn-Market, Edinburgh, continue
to sell, in Wholesale and Retail, at lowest Prices, all sorts of
Woollen Narrow and Broad Cloths of the Manufacture of Scotland, in
same manner as was done by the late Andrew Gairdner, who was one of
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>first Introducers of an extensive Manufactory of this Kind, so
very beneficial to, and so much wanted in this Country.... At above
Warehouse to be sold at lowest Rates, great Choice of Tartans, the
newest Patterns, Cotton Checks and Sarges, of which they are also
Makers.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This advertisement, it may be urged, is a stumbling-block in the way
of those who argue for the antiquity of clan patterns; for it seems
peculiar that, when the city was filled with Highlanders of all ranks
and many clans, they should be offered, not their ancient setts, but
“great choice of the newest patterns.”</p>

<p>A statement which points in exactly the contrary direction appears in
the Lockhart Papers to the following effect:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It was necessary for us [<em>i.e.</em>, the troops under the command of the
Duke of Perth and the Earl of Cromarty in the Prince’s army], in
order to come at him [<em>i.e.</em>, Lord Louden, who commanded a detachment
in the Duke of Cumberland’s army], to go about by the head of
Tyne,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> through Torendonel, about ten miles’ march, and accordingly
Glengary’s, Clanronald’s, Ardsheal’s, Glengyle’s, and Barisdale’s
battalions were ordered after them, under the command of the Duke
of Perth and Lord Cromarty. Those under Lord Louden’s command were
the M’Loads, Sir Alexander M’Donald’s men, the Makays and Monroes,
and the Grants—about three thousand in all.... We M’Donalds were
much perplex’d, in the event of ane ingagement, how to distinguish
ourselves from our bretheren and nighbours the M’Donalds of Sky,
seeing we were both Highlanders and both wore heather in our bonnets,
only our white cocades made some distinction.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The inference from the passage is, that the opposing battalions
being of the same great family, with dress and badge alike, the sole
remaining difference between them was the cockade.</p>

<p>One result of the civil war of 1745-6 was the proscription by Act of
Parliament of the Highland dress:—</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">19 George II., Cap. 39, Sec. 17, 1746.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>From and after the first day of August one thousand seven hundred

<p>“It is impossible,” writes General Stewart of Garth, “to read this
latter Act without considering it rather as an ignorant wantonness of
power than the proceeding of a wise and a beneficent Legislature. To
be compelled to wear a new dress has always been found painful. So the
Highlanders found; and it certainly was not consistent with the boasted
freedom of our country to inflict on a whole people the severest
punishment short of death for wearing a particular dress. Had the
whole race been decimated, more violent grief, indignation, and shame
could not have been excited among them than by being deprived of this
long-inherited costume. This was an encroachment on the feelings of a
people whose ancient and manly garb had been worn from a period remote
beyond all history or even tradition.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> The spirit in which the Act
was carried out may be gathered from the following extract from the
<em>General Orders to the Army in Scotland in 1748</em>:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By the act passed last session of Parliament, the time for the general
abolishing the Highland dress is enlarged to the 1st day of August
1749.</p>

<p>But that the wearing and use of such parts thereof as are called
the plaid, philibeg, or little kilt, is absolutely prohibited and
abolished from and after the 25th day of this instant December, and as
to these particulars the law takes place from that day.</p>

<p>His grace the Duke of Newcastle has therefore signified to me his
majesty’s commands, that the same be punctually observed throughout
the Highlands, and that I should give orders to all the troops
quartered in those parts to be particularly attentive to this service,
and to take all due care that the act be punctually executed and
observed, and the offenders brought to punishment according to law.</p>

<p>In obedience to these his majesty’s commands, you are to seize all
such persons as shall be found offending herein, by wearing the plaid,
philibeg, or little kilt, and carry them before a civil magistrate,
in the same dress, that he may be convinced with his own eyes of
their having offended, in order to their being punished for the same
according to law; in the performance of which, let no insult or abuse
be offered to the person or persons of those who shall be so taken
up and carried before the civil power, who are solely authorised to
inflict the punishment as the act directs; but in <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>case the magistrate
before whom such offenders are carried shall refuse or neglect putting
the law in execution, in that case let me know immediately the name
of such magistrate, with the reason of his not doing it, that I
may acquaint the Duke of Newcastle with it, who will no doubt send
immediately orders to the lord advocate of this country to prosecute
him to the utmost for his contempt of the said act, by not putting it
in execution.</p>

<p>That the people in the Highlands might have no excuse by pleading
ignorance, the lord chief justice clerk wrote to the sheriffs depute
of the Highland counties, ordering them to give notice at every parish
church, that they must quit the plaid, philibeg, or little kilt on
Christmas-day, as the act directs, otherwise they would be carried
before the civil magistrate and punished for it accordingly.</p>

<p>I must likewise desire you will let me know from time to time what
obedience the people pay to this act, for they must and shall obey it,
with the names of those magistrates who are industrious in putting the
laws in execution, that I may take an opportunity of thanking them for
performing their duty, and acquainting the Duke of Newcastle with it.</p>

<p>You may acquaint the magistrates and justices of the peace in your
neighbourhood with the contents of this letter, since it may be the
means of inciting them the more readily to perform their duty.</p>

<p><em>P.S.</em>—Let a copy of this letter be sent to the officers commanding
the general detachments of your regiment respectively.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>All manner of ingenious evasions were thought of and practised to
defeat the law. “The tight breeches,” observes General Stewart, “were
particularly obnoxious. Some who were fearful of offending, or wished
to render obedience to the law, which had not specified on what part of
the body the breeches were to be worn, satisfied themselves with having
in their possession this article of legal and loyal dress, which,
either as the signal of their submission, or more probably to suit
their own convenience when on journeys, they often suspended over their
shoulders upon their sticks; others, who were either more wary or less
submissive, sewed up the centre of the kilt with a few stitches between
the thighs, which gave it something of the form of the trowsers worn by
Dutch skippers. At first these evasions of the Act were visited with
considerable severity.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> It was most probably for conniving at some
such breach of the law that a young grenadier of the 20th Foot narrowly
escaped a tremendous punishment.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The court-martial has judged the crime of Rigby, the grenadier, to
be of so pernicious a nature that they have sentenced him to receive
six hundred lashes. His youth and former good behaviour are the only
considerations that could induce the lieutenant-colonel to pardon
him: but if hereafter any sergeant or corporal is known to receive <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>a
bribe from a Highlander, or from any person whatever, found or known
to transgress the laws, and does not seize the person or report such
transgression, he, the non-commissioned officer guilty of so heinous
a crime, will be instantly broke and severely punished: and if any
private soldier ever takes money, or a reward of any kind, that may
lead him to betray his trust, such soldier will be whipped without
mercy.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The harsh and bitter administration of the law continued for many
years—for a long enough period, indeed, to stamp out the use of the
dress, at least among the lower orders. In the south the wear of tartan
does not seem to have been interfered with. For instance, we read:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is to be sold by roup in the shop of William Watson in the front
of the New Exchange of Edinburgh upon Monday 3rd day of March next
the whole goods which belonged to the said William Watson consisting
of Tartans of all kinds poplins durants calicoes thick-sets hollands
lawns broadcloths stockings handkerchiefs ribbons worsteds and a great
variety of other goods too tedious to mention. The goods are all fresh
and in good condition and fashionable.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>James Baillie Merchant in Edinburgh has removed his warehouse to the
Exchange fronting the Tron where Tartans or Plaids with other goods
are sold as formerly.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>
</div>

<p>At length the enactment was repealed. The Marquis of Graham, afterwards
Duke of Montrose, when a Member of the House of Commons in 1782,
having brought in a Bill for the purpose, it was, according to General
Stewart, passed without a dissentient voice.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">22 George III., Cap. 63, 1782.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whereas by an act made in the nineteenth year of the reign of his
late majesty King George the Second, entituled “An act for the more
effectual disarming the Highlands in Scotland and for more effectually
securing the peace of the said Highlands; and for restraining the
use of the Highland dress;” ... it was, among other things, enacted
that from and after the first day of August one thousand seven
hundred and forty-seven, no man or boy, within that part of Great
Britain called Scotland, other than such as shall be employed as
officers and soldiers in his Majesty’s forces [&amp;c., as quoted, pp.
36-7]. And whereas it is judged expedient that so much of the acts
above mentioned as restrains the use of the Highland dress should
be repealed: Be it therefore enacted by the King’s most Excellent
Majesty, by and with the advice of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal
and Commons in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority
of the same, That so much of the acts above mentioned, or any other
act or acts of Parliament, as restrains the use of the Highland dress,
be, and the same are hereby repealed.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>
<p>The repeal of the enactment, received so joyously by the Highlanders,
was celebrated by the famous poet, Duncan Ban M’Intyre, in the
following lines, which are freely adapted from the Gaelic:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">Indulgent laws at last restore</div>
<div class="verse indent0">The noble dress our fathers wore.</div>
<div class="verse indent0">Exulting, let us then resume</div>
<div class="verse indent0">The bonnet blue and eagle plume;</div>
<div class="verse indent0">The tartan coat and jaunty vest</div>
<div class="verse indent0">And belted plaid become us best.</div>
<div class="verse indent0">With limbs unchained and footsteps free,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">In hose and brogues we’ll roam at will</div>
<div class="verse indent0">O’er purple moor and heather hill.</div>
   </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>How quickly the dress was resumed—at all events in certain portions of
the country—is shown by the following testimony. One of the Hebridean
missionaries of the Church of Scotland, whose travels among the people
extended over the eight years from 1782 to 1790, observes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The men wear the short coat, the feilabeg, and the short hose, with
bonnets sewed with black ribbons around their rims, and a slit behind
with the same ribbon in a knot. Their coats are commonly tartan,
striped with black, red, or some other colour, after a pattern made,
upon a stick, of the yarn, by themselves, or some other ingenious
contriver. Their waistcoats are either of the same, or some such
stuff; but the feilabegs are commonly of breacan, or fine Stirling
plaids, if their money can afford them.</p>

<p>At common work they use either short or long coats and breeches made
of striped cloth, and many of them very coarse, according to their
work. Their shirts are commonly made of wool; and however coarse
they may appear to strangers, they are allowed to conduce much to
the health and longevity for which this country is famous; as I have
known them eighty, ninety, and some even a hundred years old, in these
islands, and able to do their daily work.</p>

<p>When they go in quest of the herring, they dress something like the
sailors, but of coarser cloth, with hats over their eyes, to mark the
fish the better. They are careful about drying their nets, and other
fishing tackle.</p>

<p>Their brogues (shoes) are made of cow or horse leather, and often of
seals skins, that are commonly well tanned by the root of tormintile,
which they dig out from the hillocks, and uncultivated lands, about
the sea-side. This, properly pounded and prepared, without either lime
or bark, is sufficient to make the hides pliant and fit for wearing.
It answers their purpose much better than leather tanned with lime
or bark, because they seldom grow hard or shrink when dried, even
though wet all day; which is not the case with such as are burnt with
lime. They never use tan-pits, but bind the hides fast with ropes,
and hold them for several days in some remote solitary stream, until
the hair begins to come off, of its own accord; and after that, the
tormintile roots are applied for bark, as above described. Such of
the men as can afford them, wear large forest coats above their other
garb, especially on Sundays, or at the public meetings, as weddings,
burials, or fairs. Either in this or a coarse breacan (<em>i.e.</em> the
plaid) with their best apparel, they appear on these solemn occasions;
but many of those who are poor, and cannot afford it, often do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span> and
must appear in their tattered clothes and dirty shirts, without either
stockings or brogues, quite bare-footed, even in frost and snow, in
distress sufficient to extort compassion from every person, but such
tyrants as are the cause of so much misery to those starved creatures,
who are often creeping along with white or striped petticoats
belonging to their wives, or daughters and sisters, about their
shoulders.</p>

<p>The women wear long or short gowns, with a waistcoat and two
petticoats, mostly of the stripes or tartan, as already described,
except the lower coat, which is white. The married wives wear linen
mutches, or caps, either fastened with ribbons of various colours, or
with tape straps, if they cannot afford ribbons. All of them wear a
small plaid, a yard broad, called <em>guilechan</em>, about their shoulders,
fastened by a large broach. The broaches are generally round, and of
silver, if the wearer be in tolerable circumstances: if poor, the
broaches, being either circular or triangular, are of baser metal and
modern date. The first kind has been worn time immemorial even by the
ladies. The <em>arrisats</em> are quite laid aside in all this country, by
the different ranks of women; being the most ancient dress used by
that class. It consisted of one large piece of flannel, that reached
down to the shoe, and fastened with clasps below, and the large silver
broach at the breast, while the whole arm was entirely naked. The
ladies made use of the finer, while common women used coarser kinds
of flannel, or white woollen cloths. The married women bind up their
hair with a large pin into a knot on the crown of their heads, below
their linens; and the unmarried frequently go bare-headed, with their
hair bound up with ribbons, or garters. They often wear linen caps,
called mutches, particularly on Sabbaths. Many of the more wealthy
appear at church with a profusion of ribbons and head-dresses, with
cloaks and high-heeled shoes. Those whose circumstances cannot admit
of that, must appear with one of their petticoats, either tartan,
or of one colour, around their shoulders, on Sundays, as well as on
week days. They seldom travel any where without this appendage; nay,
in the house, when at such work as will admit of it; seeing it would
be thought naked in a woman to go without it: it also defends them
from the inclemency of the weather. Most of them wear napkins, or
handkerchiefs, on their necks; and many of the richest of them use
silk ones, whether black or spotted, as suits their fancies.</p>

<p>Frequently the old women wear little <em>guilechans</em>, (small plaids)
about their shoulders, and woollen hoods about their heads, with very
coarse linen under them fastened with a pin below their chins. The
<em>breeid</em>, or curtah, a fine linen handkerchief fastened about married
women’s heads, with a flap hanging behind their backs, above the
guilechan, is mostly laid aside.</p>

<p>Most of the poorer tenants cannot afford to wear brogues in Summer,
unless they are obliged to be treading among the sharp rocks on the
shores, at their master’s kelp, when the master must supply them,
except they can afford to provide for themselves. It would be too
great a luxury for a poor one to use them, unless at the same, or
similar rugged employment. Nothing short of extreme necessity obliges
them to appear in public meetings in these humiliating garbs; for
otherwise their pride would revolt at the very thought of such shabby
dresses.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>
<p>Gough thus describes the dress of the Highlanders in the district of
Breadalbane about 1789:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The dress of the men is the brechan or plaid, 12 or 13 yards of narrow
stuff wrapped round the middle and reaching to the knees, often girt
round the waist, and in cold weather covering the whole body, even
on the open hills, all night, and fastened on the shoulders with a
broche: short stockings tied below the knee; truish, a genteeler kind
of breeches, and stockings of one piece; cuoranen, a laced shoe of
skin with the hairy side out, rather disused; kelt or fillebeg, q. d.
little plaid or short petticoat, reaching to the knees, substituted of
late to the longer end of the plaid: and lastly the pouch of badger or
other skins, with tassels hanging before them. The Lochaber axe, used
now only by the town guard of Edinburgh, was a tremendous weapon. Bows
and arrows were in use in the middle of the last century, now as well
as the broadsword and target laid aside since the disarming act, but
the dirk, or ancient <em>pugio</em>, is still worn as a dress with the knife
and fork.... The women’s dress is the <em>kirch</em>, or white linen pinned
round behind like a hood, and over the foreheads of married women,
whereas maidens wear only a <em>snood</em> or ribbon round their heads: the
<em>tanac</em> or plaid fastened over their shoulders and drawn over their
heads in bad weather: a plaited long stocking, called <em>ossan</em>, is
their high dress.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>
</div>

<p>These notes bring us down to the present century, and the account of
works written on the subject which follows will give our readers some
idea of the present state of the literature relating to tartan. Before
concluding, however, it is worth while to make some special references
to one of these works, the <cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> John Sobieski
Stuart’s account of the origin of the work is as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The tract now published in the following volume, is printed from a
MS. in my possession, collated with the transcript of another in the
Library of the Monastery of St Augustine in Cadiz. It is a small
black-letter quarto of the sixteenth century, containing thirty-four
pages of vellum, illuminated with small, plain, capitals, such as the
ordinary initials of inferior missals. It was once in the possession
of the historian and faithful adherent of Queen Mary, John Lesley,
bishop of Ross, as appears by his signature in the first leaf—“Jo.
Rossen.” Immediately below is noted, in his small neat hand, “Primo
Maii, 1571, I tuck my feaver and ageu at ix huris at ny<sup>t</sup>.”... Some
of the many calamities which scattered the adherents of the house of
Stuart, and brought together many of their persons and their remains
in the Catholic seclusions of the Continent, conveyed the <cite>Vestiarium
Scoticum</cite>, and many papers of the Bishop of Ross into the Library of
the Scots College at Douay. During the long incognito of the prince
Charles Edward, between the years 1749 and 1754, he visited that
seminary, for purposes which expired in the obscurity wherein they
were planned; and, during his <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>stay, he received from the fathers many
papers which had belonged to Queen Mary, her adherents, and King James
the Seventh. Among others, of a very different nature, was found the
Bishop of Ross’s copy of the <cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite>. This copy, now in
my possession, being the oldest and the most perfect, has served as
the original to the present publication.</p>

<p>The next in value, that which belonged to the Library of the Convent
of St Augustine, is a small paper folio, bound in panel, written in
the ordinary running hand of the time of James the Sixth. By the
signature and date, it had at one time belonged to “ane honerabil man
Maister James Dunbarre w<sup>t</sup>in y<sup>e</sup> burg of Innernesse, in y<sup>e</sup> yeir of
God ain thousand sax hunder and aucht yeirs.” By a subsequent name
upon the cover—“<em>Johan O’Neil</em>, cleric”—it had probably passed
into the hands of one of the many expatriated Irish priests, who
were driven to the Continent, during the reigns of Elizabeth and
James the Sixth; and, in this revolution, probably found its way into
the Monastery of St Augustine. Spain was at that time the principal
sanctuary for the Irish and Island refugees; and it is not improbable
that the possessor of the volume might have been one of the followers
of the unfortunate James M<sup>c</sup>Donald of Isla and the Glens, who, on his
expulsion from Ulster and the Isles, fled to the Court of Philip the
Third. Between this copy and that of the Bishop of Ross there are but
very few variations, and almost all, apparently, accidental omissions
of the copyist: wherever they occur they have been noted on the margin
of this edition.</p>

<p>Besides these copies, there is, also, in my possession, a third, of a
much lower character and later period, obtained from an old Ross-shire
Highlander named John Ross, one of the last of the sword-players, who
may yet be remembered by those who recollect the porters of Edinburgh
twenty years ago. It is an inferior, modern copy, bearing the stigmats
of various barbarous hands, which have inflicted upon its pages divers
attempts to transmit to posterity the names of a certain John and
Marye Inglis, who have borne testimony to their familiarity with its
leaves in the year 1721. It is written with negligence and inaccuracy,
in a very ill hand, and with several substitutions, variations, and
omissions, which, in some instances, appear to have been the result
of carelessness; in others, the attempts of an illiterate transcriber
to adapt the work to his ideas of the clans in his own time. It may,
indeed, be conjectured that it was transcribed from an original which,
in some degree, differed from the copies of the Bishop of Ross and
the Library of St Augustine, since the names of several clans and
low-country families follow in a succession different from these MSS.
This, however, might have been the result of accidental omission and
subsequent re-entry.... These last [the three preceding copies] are
the only MSS. of that work which have fallen under my observation;
but, according to a notice communicated by Lord Lovat, it appears that
another was long in possession of the Frasers of Inchberry. Since the
removal of that family it is supposed to have been taken to America,
and is described as a small quarto MS. in black letter, containing not
only a description, but illuminations, of all the clan tartans. If
this tract was not the <cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite>, it must have been one
containing a more elaborate illustration of tartans than the work of
Sir Richard Urquhart, and of which I have discovered no other copy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>Of the author of the <cite>Vestiarium</cite> I have discovered no illustration,
and of his period there is little evidence. In his Envoi, he intimates
that he had spent the greater part of his life in military service,
and that, at various times, he had composed some works upon heraldry,
hunting, and the use of arms; but of these productions I am not aware
of any existing notices; and I know of no one of his name who has
pursued such studies, except the genealogical knight, <em>Sir Thomas</em>,
who deduced the descent of his family from Adam.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The contents of the <cite>Vestiarium</cite> are remarkable. In a short
introduction the author rebukes his countrymen for their adoption of
foreign modes to the neglect of those of their ancestors, and, lest
the old Scots fashions should sink into oblivion, as in the case
of other nations, “<cite lang="sco">I have taken on hande to compil accordant to my
pvir habylitye, a trewe ensample off alle or the maiste parte, the
pryncyppul tartanis of Scotlonde sic as I may discerne them.</cite>” A short
treatise “<cite lang="sco">of the settiss or stryppis and coullouris of terteinis</cite>”
follows. Then come in succession the tartans of the chief Highland
clans, each tartan being described with a technical minuteness which
permits of their representation, either by way of illustration or in a
fabric, with perfect ease and certainty. The tartans of the clans of
the lesser families or houses in the Highlands, and, after them, those
of the Low Country or Border clans, are detailed in a similar manner.
Short notes on the plaids worn by women, and on hose and trews, with a
list of the badges of clans and families, and a poetical conclusion,
complete the volume.</p>

<p>As to the dates when the three works on which the <cite>Vestiarium</cite> is based
came into his possession, the editor is explicit in reference to only
one—that obtained from John Ross, the old swordsman, of which he got
possession in 1819.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The two others were, however, several years in
his possession before publication, and he had apparently no intention
of giving their contents to the world until urged to do so by the late
Sir Thomas Dick Lauder. In 1829 Sir Thomas was staying at Relugas House
in Morayshire, while John Sobieski Stuart and his brother, Charles
Edward Stuart, under the name of Hay, or Hay Allan, were occupants of
Logie, about a mile from Relugas. Sir Thomas brought the MSS. under
Sir Walter Scott’s notice in a letter dated from Relugas 1st June
1829, in which he gives a general account of the only one of the three
manuscripts referred to in the introduction to the <cite>Vestiarium</cite> which
was ever in his possession—viz., John Ross’s copy<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>—from which the
transcript now in possession of Miss Dick Lauder was made.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> It was
lent him for the purpose by <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>John Sobieski Stuart, and it contains
those skits which it was prophesied at the time would cast ridicule on
the original.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> He writes to Sir Walter:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I wish to communicate to you an account of a very curious manuscript
which I have great hope may interest you as much as it has done me.
It is entitled <em>Liber Vest[i]arium Scotia, otherwise <cite lang="sco">clippit the
Garderope of Scotland, Beand ane Mirrour to shewe the true Tertaynis
of the principal Scottyshe famylies, be Schyr Richarde Urquharde
Knychte</cite></em>. The original belongs to Mr Allan Hay, father to the Messrs
Hay, now residing at Logie House, within a mile of this place. It is
written in beautifully clear and distinct black letter, and belonged
to Lesly, Bishop of Ross, the historian, whose autograph is on it in
the shape of a curious memorandum. To give you some idea of the style
of the manuscript I shall copy the following commencement of the
preface, in which the time when it was written is sufficiently marked
by internal evidence:—</p>

<p>Forasmeikle, &amp;c. [The remainder of the quotation from the introduction
is not written into the copy of Sir Thomas’s letter retained by him.]</p>

<p>After this follows a dissertation on the rules for making tartan,
which is prefaced thus:—</p>

<p>First, for the manner of making and devising of tertennis, &amp;c. [Here
again the quotation stops short.]</p>

<p>From this last quotation we are made aware of a fact of which I
confess myself to have been always very sceptical hitherto. I
mean that tartans were some centuries ago in use universally over
Scotland, and accordingly the author of the manuscript, after giving
us first descriptions of thirty-eight different tartans belonging
to the principal Highland families, and eleven of the “terteinis of
lesser famylies or houses, the quhilk be comand frae the cheff houses
and original clannes,” goes on with “<cite lang="sco">Here begynnethe off the Laich
Cuntre Pairtes and Border clannes</cite>,” of which families he gives us the
description of twenty-nine tartans. Among these last you may believe
the tartan of the illustrious family of Scott is not forgotten. The
descriptions are all so very particular that it is quite impossible
to mistake them, and as I wished to possess myself of a copy of the
manuscript (which I wrote out myself), Mr Charles Stuart Hay, with
very great politeness, agreed to illuminate it for me, with drawings
of all the tartans, a work which occupied him unceasingly for above
three weeks, by which labour he has made me a most beautiful book.
There is no printed copy of the manuscript, but the Messrs Hay,
Junior, are in possession of a manuscript copy which is very old,
and I have heard of another manuscript copy of it which did exist
somewhere in Strathglass, but which has been ineffectually sought for
as yet. The original came into the family of Mr Allan Hay from the
unfortunate Prince Charles Stuart. So far as I know it is now the
oldest and best authority (perhaps I should say the only authority)
on the subject of tartans; and in these times of rage for tartans,
when the most uncouth spurious modern “coats of many colours” are
every day invented, manufactured, christened after particular names
and worn as genuine, a book of this kind containing authority so
invaluable must become extremely popular. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>At present a woful want
of knowledge on the subject prevails. Some of the clans are at this
moment ignorantly disputing for the right to the same tartans, which,
in fact, belongs to none of them, but are merely modern inventions for
clothing Regimental Highlanders. Hardly does one of the clans now wear
its tartan with its legitimate sets, stripes, and spranges perfect in
all their parts. The Messrs Hay have already instructed several of
the chiefs of clans who have had webs of their true tartans made; and
as one instance of this I may mention that Cluny Macpherson appeared
at the late fancy ball at Edinburgh in his beautiful and genuine
tartan as taken from the MS.: viz., “thre wyde stryppes of black
upon a white fielde, and throuchout the mydward black ain yellowe,
and upon the quite sett twa spranges of crimsoun of ten thredis;”
which excited universal admiration. Macleod has got a sketch of his
splendid tartan, “three black stryps upon ain yellow fylde,” &amp;c. His
and MacLauchlane’s, both families of Norwegian origin, being the
only yellow fields. Comyn, who was quite ignorant of his tartan, has
now worn more than ever at the Caledonian balls in London his “twa
wyd strypis of greine upon ain scarlatt field,” &amp;c.; and so of many
more whom the Messrs Hay have enlightened as being their particular
friends. A curious cor[r]oboration of the accuracy of the manuscript
(if cor[r]oboration had been wanting) occurred in the case of Lovat.
Talking of his tartan, he told the Messrs Hay that, although the
tartan he then wore was that which was always worn by the Clan Fraser
as their clan tartan, yet some old people of the name maintained
that there should be a white sprainge through it. The Messrs Hay, on
consulting the manuscript, found the tartan to be exactly as worn
by Lovat, with the addition of the white sprainge, and described
as follows:—“Frizzel hath fovr strippes upone ain scarlatt fyeld
quhairoff the outerward be of greine, and the innerward of blewe,
and upon the scarlatte sette ys ane sprainge of quhite of saxteine
threids,” &amp;c., &amp;c. I need not mention any more but that of Scott,
which is as follows:—“Scott hathe four stryppis upon ain fyeld,”
&amp;c., &amp;c. But to illustrate this perfectly to you I have begged of
my friend, Mr Charles Stuart Hay, to make for you the accompanying
colored drawing, on the back of which you have the different colors
accurately laid down of their proper relative breadths, and the
whole of the proper size for weaving, so that you have only to send
the sheet to Messrs Wilson, Carpet and Tartan manufacturers at
Bannockburn, who will make you any quantity of the tartan, soft, hard,
or delicately fine merino, as you may specify, and in every respect
perfectly correct as to pattern, they having already executed many
orders from similar drawings and directions by Mr Hay. So I hope
to see both you and Miss Scott doing honour to the ancient garb of
your antecessors (<em>sic</em>), though ladies, as you will afterwards see,
being rather difficult to fix, were left very much to their “awin
fauntasyes” in such matters. That I may complete the account of this
curious manuscript I may add that after the tartans have been gone
through we have a dissertation of “<cite lang="sco">womenis quhite plaids clyppit
Arryssadis, the quhilk are not orderit after their clannes, but after
their awin conceits and as it liketh them</cite>.” Then we have a short
treatise of “Hoses and Trewsis,” and then “Hereafter followethe of
senyes of divers clannes,” &amp;c., in the list of which I find “Scotte,
Blaeberrye,” with which I hope Miss Scott will adorn her head at the
next ball she honours with her presence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span> and so make war fairly under
her proper badge. The whole concludes, as most books of those times
were wont to do, with a L’Envoy in the following lines:—</p>

<p>Dames and Lordyngis. [Here the quotation ends in Sir Thomas’s copy. It
has been considered unnecessary to reprint the lines with which the
<cite>Vestiarium</cite> concludes.]</p>

<p>What Sir Richard Urquhart the author was I have not yet made out, but
presume that he was of the Cromarty family, though I confess I cannot
find one of the name corresponding to the times in the celebrated
Urquhart genealogy, which begins with Adam. I think I have now told
you enough of this curious MS. to lead you to approve of the advice I
have given to the brothers Messrs Hay, that they ought to publish it
without one moment’s delay, illustrated with minute specimens of all
the tartans described in it, with a scale attached to each, so as to
make one aware of the proper size the cloth should be wrought. This,
I am happy to say, I have prevailed on them to do, and the plan they
think of is to print it at their own expense after they shall have
got as many subscribers as will ensure their being no losers; and as
engravings would not only be deadly as to cost, but totally inadequate
to the purpose of giving specimens of the tartans, and, indeed,
useless where the effect cannot be given without colouring them with
the same trouble that is bestowed on a drawing, they have resolved to
get a given number of yards of silk ribbon woven of each pattern of
the breadth of ladies sash ribbons, whence pieces of perhaps four or
six inches in length may be cut and neatly laid down with paste on
drawing paper, which will make a cheap, novel, very beautiful, and
most satisfactory illustration to the work, and render it in every
respect a popular as it will be an elegant national work for the
drawing-room table, which cannot fail to be much in request.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> I
mean to write to Mr Cadell and the Taits to get information for the
gentlemen as to the expense of printing and publishing the work, and
they have already written to Wilson at Bannockburn about the silk
ribbons. If you should happen to see Mr Cadell, your noticing the
work to him would be very obliging; and if you find my description
of it sufficiently interesting to induce you to talk of it to your
friends, and, above all, if you could notice it publicly at the Royal
and Antiquarian Societies, and at the Highland Society, and Celtic
Society, Border Club, &amp;c., you would do more good in paving the way
for its success than a thousand advertisements, and would confer a
very great obligation on the Messrs Hay.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Sir Walter’s reply is dated 7th June 1829. That portion of it relating
to the present subject is here transcribed:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I need not say I have the greatest interest in the MS. which you
mention, in case it shall really prove an authentic document. There
would not be the least <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>difficulty in getting the Bannatyne Club to
take, perhaps, 100 copies, or obtaining support enough so as at the
least to preclude the possibility of loss to the ingenious Messrs Hay
Allans. But I think it indispensable that the original MS. should be
sent for a month or so to the Register House, under the charge of the
Deputy Register, Mr Thomson, that its antiquity be closely scrutinised
by competent persons. The art of imitating ancient writing has got
to a considerable perfection, and it has been the bane of Scottish
literature and disgrace of her antiquities that we have manifested an
eager propensity to believe without inquiry and propagate the errors
which we adopt too hastily ourselves. The general proposition that
the Lowlanders ever wore plaids is difficult to swallow. They were of
twenty different races, and almost all distinctly different from the
Scoto-Irish, who are the proper Scots, from which the Royal Family
are descended. For instance, there is scarce a great family in the
Lowlands of Scotland that is not to be traced to the Normans, the
proudest as well as most civilised race in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries. Is it natural to think that, holdin[g] the Scots in the
contempt in which they did, they would have adopted their dress?...
I could shew, I think, that there is no period in Scottish history
when the manners, language, or dress of the Highlanders were adopted
in the low country. They brought them with them from Ireland, as
you will see from the very curious prints in Derricke’s picture of
Ireland, where you see the chief and followers of the wild Irish in
the ordinary Highland dress <em>tempore</em> Queen Elizabeth. Besides this,
where has slept this universal custom that nowhere, unless in this
MS., is it even heard of? Lesley knew it not, though the work had
been in his possession, and his attention must have been called to
it when writing concerning the three races of Scots, Highlanders,
Lowlanders, and bordermen, and treating of their dress in particular.
Andrew Borde knows nothing of [it], nor the Frenchman who published
the geographical work from which Pinkerton copied the prints of the
Highlander and Lowlander, the former in a frieze plaid or mantle,
while the Lowlander strides away in a cloak and trunk hose, like his
neighbour the Fleming. I will not state other objections, though so
many occur, that the authenticity of the MS. being proved, I would
rather suppose the author had been some tartan weaver zealous for
his craft, who wished to extend the use of tartan over the whole
kingdom. I have been told, and believe till now, that the use of
tartan was never general in Scotland (Lowlands) until the Union, when
the detestation of that measure led it to be adopted as the national
colour, and the ladies all affected tartan screens.</p>
</div>

<p>To this letter Sir Thomas sent a reply dated 20th July 1829:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Messrs Hay have shewn no backwardness to obey your wishes [<em>i.e.</em>,
to send the MS. for inspection]. I read to them that part of your
letter intended for their ears (keeping, of course, strictly to
myself all that was confidential) [Sir Thomas, no doubt, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>refers to
the second portion of Sir Walter’s letter relating to the descent of
John Sobieski Stuart and his brother Charles Edward, which, as having
no relation to the subject of this work, has not been reproduced],
when they displayed every possible readiness to get the older copy of
the MS. sent from London, where it is in their father’s possession,
to Edinburgh, as you desire; and accordingly they took an early
opportunity of writing to their father to beg he would send it without
delay. Meanwhile they immediately put into my hands the old copy of
the MS. in their possession,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> with full powers to transmit it to
you. In the event of their father having any doubt about parting with
what he values as the apple of his eye, they suggested the alternative
of the MS. being examined in London by Meyrick, or any of the people
about the British Museum, or any one else, in short, in whose judgment
in such matters you could have confidence. I may repeat again that
there are two copies of the MS. in their family, viz., that which is
believed to be the original, which is in possession of the father in
London, and that which is presumed to be a copy (though a copy of
above a century old). The latter is in my custody at this moment,
ready to be sent you. But I very much regret that the father not only
refuses the request made to him about sending down the London MS.,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
but also expresses the strongest objection to its publication. I shall
copy for you what he says by-and-bye, but before doing so I shall
copy for you the description of the London or original MS., which
description was sent down some time ago at my request in a letter from
the father:—</p>

<p>My copy of the <cite>Vest[i]arium Scotiæ</cite> is written on vellum in the
common black letter hand of the sixteenth century, with illuminated
capitals at the heads of sections of the kind used in ordinary
missals. There are thirty-four pages in the book, which is a small
quarto, bound in white vellum, and stamped and gilt. I never heard
of any other MS. copy of the work than that in our possession, but
there was a printed copy made by order of the late prince, with an
introduction describing the book and containing facsimiles of the
capitals, and the Bishop of Ross’s date. By the former it appeared
that the original had been in the Library of the Scots College at
Douay, and from it was removed, with many other of the MSS. of that
body, and presented to His Royal Highness some time afterwards. The
printed copy was in possession of His Royal Highness the Cardinal of
York a short time before his death, and is supposed to have fallen
into the hands of the English Government, and along with what they
obtained of the Stuart papers.</p>

<p>In addition to this information about the MS. (which I asked for that
I might put it as a memorandum on my own copy), Mr Hay sent me a
traced facsimile of the Bishop of Ross’s name and notandum, which I
read, “Jo. Rossen, primo Maii 1571. I tuck my feaver and ageu at ix
huris at ny<sup>t</sup>.” This I now enclose for your inspection, with a request
that you will have the goodness to return it to me safely when you
have had leisure to satisfy yourself perfectly with it, as I mean to
paste it on to a blank leaf in my copy. It is not impossible that you
may know of or hear of some signatures of John Leslie’s to be found
in some of the public collections in Edinburgh. If so, it <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>would be
curious to compare this facsimile with it. And now with regard to the
father’s letter refusing to send the original MS. I copy it <em>verbatim</em>
from the first half sheet of it, which his son has torn off and sent
me:—</p>

<p><em>July 5th, 1829.</em>—<span class="smcap">My dearest Ian</span>,—I have been reflecting
upon all which you request concerning the MS., but you know that
there are certain things about which I never consult either the
feelings or the opinions of others, but act up to previous unalterable
determinations; therefore I feel sorry that you did not consult me
before you gave any acquiescence to the purpose of publishing the
<cite>Garderope of Scotland</cite>, as you ought to have remembered the private
memorandums written on the blank leaves, and that it was impossible,
coupled with other circumstances, to subject them to common curiosity,
which neither I nor you can think of for a moment to reclaim the whole
history and use of tartan from oblivion. [As to the opinion of Sir
Walter Scott, inasmuch as I never heard it respected among antiquaries
as of the least value, it is quite indifferent to me.]<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> I wish for
no connection with the public either for me or mine, or anything in my
possession; and if you had kept still more retired from observation
the relics of which I gratified you and Charles by the keeping, it
would have been a much better proof of your regard for them and
respect to the memory of those to whom they belonged. Love to all, and
believe me, my dearest Ian, your affectionate father,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">J. T. Stuart Hay</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>Sir Thomas Dick Lauder considered this refusal to be quixotic; but
it was absolute. He addresses himself at great length to the task of
proving the high character for veracity of the Messrs Hay, and he
adds:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I cannot for a moment believe that the brothers Allan Hay could be
guilty of the fraud of attempting to foist a forged manuscript upon
me. And, indeed, for what purpose should they attempt so base a thing?
Not, certainly, from a thirst for publication, because they never
entertained the idea of printing it until repeatedly urged to do so by
myself and some other friends who happened to see it, not through any
ostentation of theirs, but more as matter of accident than anything
else, for they did not seem to set any great value on their old copy.</p>

<p>But although you may be very ready to acquit the Allan Hays of being
the impostors, yet it must be admitted that the MS. may nevertheless
be a forgery. But if the Allan Hays be acquitted and their story be
believed, we then establish that, if there be forgery at all, it must
be a forgery of some antiquity. Now, in trying this alternative I
confess I think it much more difficult to believe that any one could
have undertaken so tedious and fruitless a labour in times when MSS.
were much less cared about than they are now, than to believe that the
MS. in question really is what it pretends to be. And I do think that
the internal evidence of the manuscript itself is very strongly in
its favour, and that it is extremely unlikely that any one could have
constructed a cheat with so many genuine characters about it. With all
this, I must also own that the mere circumstance that Sir Walter Scott
doubts is enough to shake the firmest opinion.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>
<p>To Sir Thomas Dick Lauder’s letter of 20th July Sir Walter Scott
replied on 19th November, and that portion of his reply which relates
to the <cite>Vestiarium</cite> is in the following terms:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As for the <cite>Vestiarium</cite>, without pretending to know how it may have
been got up, it is not, as Audrey says, a true thing, and, allowing
the ingenuity of your arguments, one is obliged to allow so many
extremely improbable circumstances and mere possibilities, that if
any single one of them is not so weighty as to break down the whole
system, their combined influence certainly will do so.</p>

<p>I cannot believe there is any copy of such a work among the Cardinal
Duke of York’s papers. I am one of the commissioners for examining
these papers, which are to a certain extent already catalogued. I
will, however, keep a look out for the work of Master Urquhart,
which I think his name is. To suppose Lowlanders to be Highlanders
we must suppose that they spoke the Gaelick, and held the system of
clanship. Without this there could be no occasion for wearing clan
tartans. Now, every law or regulation concerning clanship is limited
to the Highlands and to the Borders, who seem to have it as a tie of
communion calculated to bind a tribe strongly together. But we are
now required to believe that there was none of that distinction of
dress at all, and if not of dress, why should there have been any
difference of language or laws? A nation’s dress is much more easily
changed than its manners and language; but here the dress alone
remains, the manners and language that associated with it are totally
gone. The idea of distinguishing the clans by their tartans is but a
fashion of modern date in the Highlands themselves; much less could
it be supposed to be carried to such an extent in the Lowlands as the
manuscript pretends. Tartan itself is unquestionably a Lowland word,
and the stuff “tiretain” fetched from Flanders, and I suspect the
Highlander wore a frieze mantle like the Irish chief, without what we
now call the bracken.</p>
</div>

<p>To this letter Sir Thomas replied on 29th November 1829. By that time
the terrible calamity, of which he gives so vivid a picture in the
<cite>Moray Floods</cite>, had happened to Relugas, and he appears to have had
little heart to write about anything else. But he makes an allusion to
the <cite>Vestiarium</cite>; and a very striking one it is. With all deference
to the very distinct expressions of opinion by his distinguished
correspondent, he observes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I confess I am still a believer. What do you think of the facsimile of
old Leslie’s handwriting? By-the-bye, I will thank you to send it me
in Mr Hay’s parcel,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> to save me from sending to London for another.
I have examined the old copy of the manuscript in my possession,<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
and find the water-mark of the paper to be ante-Union, the supporters
to the arms being two unicorns.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>
<p>Here closes this remarkable correspondence, and we hear no more of the
<cite>Vestiarium</cite> until its publication by Tait in 1842, with the name of
John Sobieski Stuart on the title-page as editor. So remarkable a work
could not fail to attract attention. The most striking criticism on
the book, so far as ability and bitterness went, and the only one to
which any reply was vouchsafed, is that contained in the <cite>Quarterly
Review</cite> for June 1847.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> This criticism the brothers Stuart believed
to have been written by the late Mr Dennistoun, but it was in reality
the work of the late Professor George Skene, of Glasgow University,
brother of the late Dr. William Forbes Skene, from materials furnished
chiefly by the late Dr. Mackintosh Mackay. One half of the criticism
consists of an unsparing attack on the alleged claims of the brothers
to Royal descent, and the other of an attack upon the authenticity of
the <cite>Vestiarium</cite>. Professor Skene first proposed to discuss the printed
text for indications of its genuineness, or the reverse. Had he done
so, the result could hardly have failed to be interesting, the language
of the work offering a fair field for criticism. He not only did not
do so, but fell into a series of very extraordinary errors regarding
facts. He wrote:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We cannot find that the actual MS., “which belonged to the Douay
College,” and “contains the signature of the Bishop of Ross,” has
ever been exhibited to any learned society in the north, or even to
any individual scholar or antiquary unconnected with the present
publication; but about twenty years ago, a <em>description</em> of the MS.,
with a <em>transcript</em> of part, at least, if not the whole of it, was
sent to the Society of Scottish Antiquaries, with a request that they
would patronise its publication; and by their secretary the specimen
was placed in the hands of Sir Walter Scott, who kindly undertook
to examine it, and give the society the benefit of his opinion as
to its authenticity. The secretary, accompanied by our informant,
a reverend friend deeply versed in Highland lore, waited upon him
shortly afterwards to ascertain the result of the scrutiny. Sir Walter
assured them that the style and dialect of the specimen shewn him
were utterly false, a most feeble and clumsy imitation of the genuine
writing of the period, and indignantly declared his conviction that
the manuscript itself must be an absolute fabrication.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To this attack the editor of the <cite>Vestiarium</cite> made the following
reply:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The reviewer proceeds to proclaim an opinion asserted to have been
delivered by Sir Walter Scott, that the MS. was a clumsy imitation of
the genuine writing of its professed period, “and unentitled to any
credit.” The reviewer, however, has concealed that Sir Walter Scott
never saw the original MS., and that he died some years before the
publication of the printed edition—consequently that he never had any
opportunity of forming a judgment even from a careful and formal copy.
According to the acknowledgment of <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>the reviewer himself, the asserted
opinion of Sir Walter was founded upon a “description of the MS.,
with a transcript of a part, if not the whole.” How far any critic
could presume to form a judgment upon any “transcript,” especially
an imperfect “part,” of a work, we leave to the experience of those
accustomed to the criticism of old writings. But the reviewer has
farther concealed the nature of the “transcript” said to have been
exhibited to Sir Walter Scott. After the originals of the <cite>Vestiarium</cite>
were in the possession of its editor, there never was made more than
one “transcript,” that alluded to by the reviewer as “a transcript
obtained by a gentleman in the north.” This copy, or, as admitted by
the reviewer, “a part,” was transmitted by the transcriber to some of
his friends in Edinburgh, at which time we believe, as asserted by the
reviewer, it was casually shewn to Sir Walter Scott. The reviewer,
however, has concealed the nature of this transcript, upon which Sir
Walter’s asserted opinion is so maliciously quoted. Far from being, as
might have been expected, a critical facsimile, or even matter-of-fact
copy from the original, it was a sort of “Hood’s Comic Almanack” of
tartans, neatly written, not in “clerks’,” “scriveners’,” or any other
MS. text of the sixteenth century, but in ordinary Roman letter,
consequently, exhibiting no “imitation” of the “genuine writing” of
the period, said to have been contra-distinguished in Sir Walter’s
observation, and still farther at variance with the original, or any
object of serious criticism, by being illustrated in vermilion, with
bizarre caricatures in the form of burlesque head and tail pieces,
generally graphic puns and hieroglyphics for the name of each family
whose title they adorned. Of their description, consequently, of the
serious character of the MS. of which Sir Walter Scott’s criticism is
so gravely reported, a conclusion may be formed by a few examples,
such as, for “Dundas” the sketch of a small “Dun,” and on its summit
an “ass.” For Brodie (pronounced in Scots Broadie), a large, <em>i.e.</em>,
a “Broad” “eye.” And for Montgomery the view of a mount, enlivened by
several dancing figures, intended to associate the idea of “go-merry,”
and the like. Such is the manuscript said to have been exhibited to
and condemned by Sir Walter Scott as “of no authority whatever.” Its
removal from authority, however, was farther extended by the fact that
it was not even a transcript of the oldest MS. on which the reviewer
sits in judgment, but of an inferior, tattered, and inaccurate copy,
no older than the year 1721, and which was the only one “in the north”
when the amiable and distinguished friend<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> of the possessor,
designated by the reviewer after that borealian locality, made the
transcript, with which he amused some idle winter days, with the
conceits which, it was then predicted, would extend to the original a
connection of misconception and ridicule.</p>

<p>According to this expectation, all those who became acquainted with
the tract only through the medium of the copy supposed that the
illustrations, as well as the text, were equally facsimiles of the
original MS.; and if Sir Walter Scott had no explanation to the
contrary, he, of course, entertained the same conclusion, and thus
must have supposed the tract a greater enormity of absurdity than has
even been assumed by the reviewer.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Professor Skene, writing of what happened “about twenty years ago”
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>concerning an affair in which he took no part, may well have fallen
into casual error, but his “reverend friend deeply versed in Highland
lore” ought to have had some memory. The correspondence between Sir
Thomas Dick Lauder and Sir Walter Scott clearly shows that John Ross’s
MS. was first brought under Sir Walter’s notice in June 1829, a period
fairly enough corresponding in 1847 to “twenty years ago.” But the
only “description,” or “transcript,” of the part or whole he ever saw
was that contained in Sir Thomas’s letter of 1st June 1829, and how
far the materials there given enabled Sir Walter to form a judgment of
the style, dialect, or writing of the original may be gathered from
the fact that he made no attempt to do so. There are Sir Walter’s own
letters of 7th June and 19th November 1829 on the subject, in which
his unfavourable opinion of the authenticity of the <cite>Vestiarium</cite> is
based, not upon the appearance or language of the manuscript, which he
had no opportunity of examining, but upon its ascription of tartans to
the Lowlanders, to the lack of express notices on the subject by early
writers, and to the use of the tartans as distinguishing the clans. Sir
Walter wrote with the knowledge of his period, and how far his views
are borne out by later investigation may be gathered by a study of the
contents of the preceding pages.</p>

<p>Professor Skene’s statements—first, that a description of the
manuscript, with a transcript of part, if not the whole of it, was
sent to the Society of Scottish Antiquaries, with a request that they
would patronise its publication; second, that the specimen was placed
by their secretary in the hands of Sir Walter Scott, who undertook to
express an opinion upon it; and, third, that the secretary and “our
informant” afterwards waited upon Sir Walter to ascertain what his
opinion was—are unverified. All that has yet been discovered, indeed,
goes to show that nothing of the kind ever took place, and that the
“facts” stated in the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> had their origin only in the
imagination of the learned professor’s “reverend friend.” The minutes
of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland for that period are yet in
existence. They are kept with a careful, even a tedious minuteness; and
is it possible to suppose that the series of events detailed in the
<cite>Quarterly Review</cite> of June 1847 as having taken place “about twenty
years ago,” involving questions of such importance to antiquaries,
especially to Scottish antiquaries, could have been entirely omitted
from them? Yet they are. No mention whatever of the circumstances
stated by Professor Skene to have occurred “about twenty years ago”
appears.</p>

<p>John Sobieski Stuart’s position in the affair is quite plain. We
find from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span> the correspondence that all Sir Walter really saw was the
description and extracts contained in Sir Thomas’s letter of 1st June
1829; but the editor of the <cite>Vestiarium</cite>, aware of the fact that Sir
Thomas had a transcript of the work, which he had expressly offered
to show Sir Walter, and confronted with the absolute statement by
Professor Skene, on the authority of his “reverend friend,” that Sir
Walter had seen a transcript, arrived naturally at the conclusion that
the transcript Sir Walter was asserted to have seen was the only one in
existence, that made by Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, and directed his reply
accordingly. Had he been aware of the real facts of the case, his reply
to Professor Skene might have been even more crushing than it was.</p>

<p>Professor Skene made an attack in another quarter. He questioned the
authenticity of the work on the ground that there were several and
serious errors in the genealogies of the clans whose tartans are
described, and he specified particularly M’Nab, Farquharson, Clan Gun,
Cluny Macpherson, and Mackintosh, the occurrence of errors in regard
to whose genealogies, he urged, demonstrated that the <cite>Vestiarium</cite> was
a forgery. To reply to these criticisms John Sobieski Stuart seriously
set himself, and with remarkable ability and success.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Finally, Professor Skene fell foul of the Bishop of Ross’s signature.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It matters little to the public who was the perpetrator of the present
forgery. It may have been “<em>the late</em> Mr Robert Walker,”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> who is
so ready with an entry from “the Bishop’s Diary” in its support—a
“Diary” which, like Mr Sobieski Stuart’s MS. itself, formed “part of
the Douay papers.”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> It may have been the defunct porter of Auld
Reekie, John Ross, from whom one of the copies is said to have been
procured. And <em>apropos</em> of this latter possibility we would recommend
Mr Sobieski Stuart to again look at his original MS., and consider
whether what he has taken for the signature of the well-known bishop,
John of Ross, be not in fact a quaint attempt of his friend the
sword-player to write his own name in an old hand, after practising
upon the fever and ague notice which accompanies it.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>
</div>

<p>To this taunt John Sobieski Stuart made no reply. Possibly it was
beyond his power to give any example of the bishop’s signature beyond
the one in his possession. And yet the propriety of comparing an
authoritative example of Leslie’s handwriting with that appearing in
the <cite>Vestiarium</cite> <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>obviously suggests itself, and did not escape Sir
Thomas Dick Lauder’s observation. He wrote on 20th July 1829,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
enclosing Sir Walter Scott a traced facsimile of the signature for
his satisfaction, and adding “it is not impossible you may know of or
hear of some signatures of John Leslie’s to be found in some of the
public collections in Edinburgh. If so, it would be curious to compare
this facsimile with it.” Of this request no notice appears to have
been taken by Sir Walter, and Sir Thomas again returns to the charge
on 29th November,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> when he asked Sir Walter for his opinion of
the authenticity of the signature, and requesting him to return the
facsimile. But the day of Sir Walter’s own trouble had come, and he
contented himself with returning the facsimile to Sir Thomas without
any attempt at verification. One obvious explanation of Sir Walter’s
proceeding is that the public records were not then so accessible as
they are now, and a search must have proved both tedious and expensive.</p>

<p>Of Leslie’s signature as Bishop of Ross (Jo. Rossen.) not many examples
are available, but the Editor’s attention has been drawn to one in the
<cite>Lord Treasurer’s Accounts</cite>. It is submitted that the reader may be
able to form an opinion as to whether the facsimile in the <cite>Vestiarium</cite>
is more likely to represent the signature of the Bishop of Ross or the
scrawl of an Edinburgh street porter of 1819.</p>

<a id="Footnote_85" href="#FNanchor_85" class="label">[85]</a> It may be proper to point out here that the Editor discussed the idea of issuing a work on rare
    tartans, to be illustrated by examples of the actual fabrics, with his publisher several years ago, and it was
    not until the illustrations for the present work were considerably advanced that he became aware of the
    existence of Miss Dick Lauder’s copy of the <cite>Vestiarium</cite>, which she has so handsomely placed at his disposal,
    and which contains the statement in the text.

<a id="Footnote_105" href="#FNanchor_105" class="label">[105]</a> Why the simple red and black check receives the title
    of Rob Roy is something of a mystery. In <cite>Authenticated Tartans of
    the Clans and Families of Scotland</cite> (Smith: Mauchline, 1850) it is
    asserted, and the statement is repeated in <cite>The Tartans of the Clans
    of Scotland</cite> (W. &amp; A. K. Johnston: Edinburgh, 1886) without attempt at
    verification, that three genuine portraits of Rob Roy represent him as
    wearing it; but these and other so-called Rob Roy portraits—be their
    value what it may—afford no sanction whatever for the design. The
    Editor is not aware on what authority the portraits are classed as Rob
    Roy. He has seen seven paintings, including the three above referred
    to, in which the figure is identical, all known as Rob Roy, and in each
    a separate pattern appears, none of them showing the simple red and
    black check. The tartan is accepted by sound authorities as the old
    Macgregor clan pattern. There are fine examples of it in a collection
    of tartans made by the Highland Society of London in 1816-17, labelled
    and sealed “The MacGregor Tartan for undress ordinary clothing. The
    Seal of Arms of Sir John MacGregor Murray of MacGregor, Baronet.
    [Signed] John M. Murray.”

<h4>NOTES ON WORKS TREATING OF TARTANS.</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. <cite>The Scottish Gaël; or, Celtic Manners as preserved among the
Highlanders</cite>: Being an Historical and Descriptive Account of the
Inhabitants, Antiquities, and National Peculiarities of Scotland; more
particularly of the Northern or Gaëlic Parts of the Country, where the
singular habits of the Aboriginal Celts are most tenaciously retained.
By James Logan, Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.
London: Smith, Elder, &amp; Co., 65 Cornhill. 1831. 2 vols. 8vo. Large
paper in royal 8vo.</p>
</div>

<p>This work contains in an appendix a list of fifty-four tartans, which
Logan states were as many as he could procure and authenticate. Along
with the name of each tartan is a table stating the colours and
relative proportions of the stripes in eighths of an inch. This plan
of measurement, it appears, was the joint idea of Logan and Captain
Mackenzie of Gruinard. It is really a modification of that of the old
Highland weavers of winding on a stick the correct number of threads of
each colour in the proper order. One coloured plate (an illustration
of the tartan of the Earl of Inverness) is given, with the object
of explaining the system of measurement and colouring set forth in
the work. Each volume contains a coloured frontispiece representing
Highlanders in tartan dress.</p>

<p>A reprint (omitting the plate of the tartan) was issued in 1876,
edited, with memoir and notes, by the Rev. Alexander Stewart, of
Ballachulish and Ardgour, “Nether Lochaber.” Inverness: Hugh Mackenzie,
Bank Lane. Edinburgh: Maclachlan and Stewart, South Bridge.</p>

</div>

<p>The <cite>Vestiarium</cite>, referred to at some length in the Introduction,
was, if we set aside the single plate issued by Logan in 1831, the
first work published containing illustrations of tartans. According to
Lowndes, whose information on the point was derived from the late Dr.
David Laing, only fifty copies were printed, and it is curious that
none of the great Edinburgh libraries is in possession of a complete
copy. It contains (<em>a</em>) a preface giving an account of the three MS.
copies of the work known to the editor; (<em>b</em>) a roll of the clans from
the original MS. of 1571, accompanied by the ordinary Parliamentary
rolls of 1587 and 1594, and the one compiled by Lord President Forbes
in 1745;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span> (<em>c</em>) an introduction treating very fully of the use of
tartan in early times; (<em>d</em>) the text of the MS., wherein are minutely
described (1) twenty-five tartans of the “chieff Hieland clannes;”
(2) eleven tartans of the “lesser famylies or housis, the quhilk be
cum frae ye chieff housis and oryginale clannes;” (3) thirty tartans
belonging to the “low country pairtes and bordovr clannes;” (4) nine
tartans of the “bordovr clannes;” (5) a list of clans and their badges
of distinction.</p>

<p>The illustrations of the book consist of one plate containing
reproductions of styles of dress from early seals and illuminated
manuscripts, and seventy-five coloured plates representing tartans.
The latter are executed by the “machine painting” process introduced
by the Messrs Smith, of Mauchline, for their tartan woodwork, and for
beauty of execution and exactness of detail have not been excelled by
any method of colour printing subsequently invented. The wide use made
of the tartan illustrations in this work by subsequent writers is duly
noted under the respective works.</p>

<p>Originally issued in parts, commencing in the year 1843, and
terminating in 1849, in two sizes, imperial quarto and imperial folio.
The quarto edition was reprinted by Willis, Sotheran, &amp; Co. in 1857. It
contains seventy-two coloured plates of figures illustrating various
forms, ancient and modern, of the Highland dress, drawn by M’Ian. Two
coloured frontispieces represent the heraldic shields and badges of the
clans. There is a separate pagination for each of the parts, making the
work of reference troublesome. Logan travelled over a great part of
the Highlands and Islands collecting the interesting details relating
to the clans here presented. Of the illustrations, the greater number
is based on authenticated details of dress, but many are imaginative,
as no records exist covering the period to which they are assigned.
The tartans depicted are partly those in Logan’s <cite>Scottish Gaël</cite>,
while others are unacknowledged reproductions from the designs in the
<cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite>.</p>

<p>When projected this magnificent and sumptuous work was intended to
extend to two volumes, of which only the first appeared, the cost of
production having proved excessive,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span> and entailed a heavy loss upon
the authors. It contains thirty-five plates. Of these, six, which are
uncoloured, consist of representations of Highland dress, obtained
principally from sculptured stones. The coloured plates contain
representations of thirty-seven figures, obtained from the following
sources: Paintings, 29; engravings, 5; drawing, 1; illuminated MS., 1;
medal die, 1. The work was also issued uncoloured in two states—viz.,
with India proofs, and with plain prints. Copies of the original
coloured issue are very rare, no copy being preserved in any of the
great Edinburgh libraries. I have compared the colouring of the
reprint, and also the original of the plain prints, with twenty of the
figures depicted in the paintings from which they are taken, scattered
in various family collections throughout Scotland. The remaining nine
paintings I have hitherto been unable to trace. In every instance that
has come under my observation the colouring of the plates turns out to
be not only incorrect, but as a rule hopelessly misleading. What makes
this all the more extraordinary is that the plain outline drawings
representing the original work of the authors are extremely accurate
in rendering the most minute details, except the features, which are
usually very indifferently copied. Of the remaining eight figures noted
above as in colour, seven are represented in tartan, on what authority
as to sett I have been unable to ascertain. The letterpress contains a
treatise on the Highland dress, which, considering the period at which
it was written, and the difficulty of access to the widely scattered
materials of which it is composed, is a perfect marvel of industry and
ability. It has been the productive quarry of all successive writers on
the Highland dress.</p>

<p>First issued in parts with the title on the wrapper, <cite>Original Tartans
of the Highland Clans and Lowland Families of Scotland</cite>, the preface
being dated 1st March 1850. Between the issue of the prospectus and
its accompanying plates and the completion of the publication of the
work several changes were made in the illustrations. For example, Plate
I. of the Stuart tartan was first represented as in the <cite>Vestiarium</cite>,
but was afterwards changed to the present more familiar design. For
information regarding the tartans the Messrs Smith relied chiefly
on the manufacturers, with whom the work remains the standard of
reference. It contains, however, inaccuracies in identification
and arrangement, some of which are referred to in the letterpress
accompanying the tartans in the present volume. The plates, of which
there are sixty-nine, are executed by the publishers’ process of
“machine painting” to which reference has already been made under the
<cite>Vestiarium</cite>.</p>

<p>A miniature edition (without date, a want the publishers are now unable
to supply) of the plates in the above was issued. The only letterpress
it contains is the title-page, table of contents, and the names of the
tartans.</p>

</div>

<p>In this work, which deals entirely with the histories of the clans,
there are included fifty-five coloured lithographic plates of tartans.
No individual account of these is given, but in his notice the author
states: “With respect to the Sets of the Clan-Tartans here given,
the work of Mr Logan has been held, after due consideration, to be
preferable as a general guide. The <cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite> of Mr Stuart
is certainly a publication of value in various respects, having
plainly been prepared with much elaboration and care, and accordingly
it would be unwise to reject its indications wholly, because of the
doubts entertained as to its claims to antiquity and authenticity. The
parties responsible for the present work, however, have had recourse to
the best original sources of information, and trust by that means to
maintain accuracy, without blindly following any previous authority.”
The best comment on these observations is to be found in the fact that
while the bulk of the illustrations are copied from Logan, and many
others are early and genuine examples of tartans never before that time
illustrated, a number were adopted from the <cite>Vestiarium</cite>.</p>

<p>The seventy-one tartans illustrated in this beautiful book will, with
one exception, be found to have been included in the works previously
referred to. There is, as in the case of the Messrs Smith’s book, a
number of errors in identification and arrangement. The illustrations
are the finest examples of lithographic printing as applied to tartan
designs which have hitherto appeared, and they show clearly where the
method succeeds and where it fails.</p>

<p>There has never hitherto been brought together in such a compact form
so many examples of tartans, the work containing ninety-six plates
executed by the same process as in the publishers’ larger work (No.
12). It is necessary, however, to point out that some of them are
designs invented within a few years, and of no authority as clan
tartans. A second edition, with additional notes, was issued in 1892.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"> THE LORD OF THE ISLES.</h2>
</div>


<p>The authority for the accompanying example is a portrait of Sir
Alexander (afterwards first Lord) Macdonald of the Isles, in the
collection of Lord Macdonald of the Isles, at Armadale Castle in
Skye. Of that painting, executed by an unknown artist about 1750,
the vignette on the title-page of the present work is a reproduction.
The tartan is represented only in the coat of the youth holding
the golf-club, the trews being in red and white check; and a close
inspection reveals an important addition to what has long been accepted
as the Lord of the Isles pattern—to wit, that of the black lines
intersecting the red squares. The omission of these black lines from
the modern sett is obviously accidental, for the tartan as now worn
is based on the authority of the picture, which was believed to have
been accurately copied. The origin of the error cannot be ascertained;
but, probably, a mistake in the reproduction of the design when
tartans became the wear after the repeal of the prohibitory statute
has remained undetected till now. On the canvas, at least, the
intersections are clearly depicted; and, moreover, the tartan thus
conforms to the rule of breaking large squares generally observed in
old clan patterns. <cite>The Costume of the Clans</cite>, by John Sobieski Stuart
and Charles Edward Stuart, contains a presentment of the painting
which, though professedly coloured from the original, is nevertheless
extremely inaccurate. It may be added that the tartan, which is that
usually worn by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, who bears the title of the
Lord of the Isles, has never hitherto been faithfully delineated in any
previous work nor properly reproduced in any textile fabric of modern
manufacture.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LORD OF THE ISLES: HUNTING.</h2>
</div>


<p>Like the preceding example, the present is based on a painting in
Armadale Castle—a life-size representation of the first Lord Macdonald
of the Isles, dating from about 1765. On the evidence of style the
work is ascribed to Allan Ramsay the younger, who about this period
painted many portraits in tartan costumes, in which, fortunately for
our purpose, he displays as a rule the patterns boldly and brilliantly.
Through the kindness of Lord and Lady Macdonald of the Isles the Editor
had last year an excellent opportunity of obtaining reproductions of
the tartans delineated in their family portraits. The painting in
this case was photographed to a large scale, and afterwards coloured
from the original by an experienced artist (a similar plan being
adopted in the case of Plate I.) From these the silks were woven,
carefully compared with the paintings, and so absolute accuracy of
reproduction secured. Traditionally known as the Lord of the Isles
hunting tartan, the pattern here given appears in the coat, vest, and
kilt of the figure portrayed. The statute against the wearing of the
Highland dress, including tartans, passed in 1747, was operative when
the picture was painted. It may be, however, that as the Macdonalds
of Sleat were adherents of the Government, in name at least, special
indulgence was extended to them. During the greater part of the
present century the design was not rendered in textile fabric, but
recently Lord Macdonald of the Isles had it woven for his use. With
characteristic inaccuracy of colouring, <cite>The Costume of the Clans</cite>
represents the tartan with a predominance of red, though the original
contains no trace of that colour.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="BRODIE">BRODIE.</h2>
</div>


<p>It is not known when this design was originally adopted; but, though
the pattern cannot be traced in early paintings, it nevertheless
possesses internal evidence of some antiquity, since many of the oldest
tartans are variations of the red and black check, popularly styled
the Rob Roy,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> with the addition of narrower lines of various hues,
as in the present instance. The beginning of the century witnessed
its use, as it is included in several collections of the hard tartans
produced at the time; and since then it has always figured in the
pattern-books and the lists both of connoisseurs and of manufacturers.
Certainly, it has been regarded as the true Brodie by makers as far
back as business records or traditions extend. Of late a green tartan
has been sold as undress or hunting Brodie, but it seems unsupported by
any remote authority. The pattern illustrated as the Huntly district
tartan (Plate X.) was also known as Brodie seventy years ago; it was
so called because many Brodies who belonged to the districts occupied
by the Gordons, Forbeses, and others wore it in early times as the
district tartan, and more recently in some instances adopted it as
their family pattern.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CAMPBELL OF BREADALBANE.</h2>
</div>


<p>The specimen here presented is a careful reproduction of the tartan
of Campbell of Breadalbane, as worn by the Fencibles of that district
from their embodiment in 1793 to their disbandment in 1802. The
authority is a portion of the regimental uniform of Major Campbell,
one of the officers, whose descendants now treasure it as a precious
relic. Wherever the tartan occurs in early collections, dating from
before 1790 down to 1840, the pattern agrees with the accompanying
illustration. The later date, however, witnessed the inception of a
delusion that has prevailed even to the present day; for a tartan
similar in some respects, which appears in certain early collections
under the simple designation of “fancy,” began about that time to usurp
the title of Breadalbane Campbell, and is now received as the correct
design. But the existence of this regimental dress now a century old,
the uninterrupted record of the pattern to 1840, and the proved genesis
of the spurious variety, afford the amplest justification for including
the earlier pattern in the present work. It is the only Campbell tartan
included in the collection made by the Highland Society of London in
1816-17. It is doubtful if any of the so-called Campbell tartans as
worn at the present time were in use earlier than the middle of last
century, while several are of more recent introduction. The early
Campbell portraits at Langton and Loudoun show designs entirely unlike
any Campbell tartans now in use, being chiefly red.</p>

<p>The evidence of the early date of this design rests entirely upon
specimens in collections of old hard tartans. Diligent research reveals
no portrait in Highland costume of a member of the clan, whose leading
representatives, moreover, are without any account of the origin either
of this pattern or of another bearing the same name and differing from
it mainly in the omission of the white stripe. From the collation of
many authorities and the inspection of many samples, however, the
conclusion has been reached that of the two the design here represented
is the earlier. It is preserved in a collection of examples of tartans
made by the Highland Society of London in 1822; in that of Messrs
Ogilvie &amp; Co., Edinburgh, dealers in tartan about the same period; in
that of The Mackintosh at Moy Hall, and in many others.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DRUMMOND OF PERTH.</h2>
</div>


<p>Tradition associates this tartan with the amiable, ill-fated James
Drummond, Duke of Perth, who was conspicuous in the ’45, and who died
on board a French frigate while attempting to escape in the succeeding
year. The early collections nearly all contain this pattern, which is
variously styled Drummond of Perth, Drummond, and Perth. Portraits of
the Duke in tartan garb are in the possession of the Duke of Richmond
and Gordon at Gordon Castle, and of Lord Ancaster at Drummond Castle,
but in neither case is the painting sufficiently distinct for the
confirmation of details. The Murray-Threipland family preserve at
Fingask Castle a cloak said to have been left there by Prince Charles
Edward; and its design, reproduced in Plate XL., is the Drummond of
Perth, with the exception of a narrow line. It is probable either
that the garment belonged to the Duke, or that it was made for the
Prince from some of his tartan. The pattern now commonly worn by the
Drummonds is likewise claimed by the Grants, the sett of the latter
varying only by the shade of a blue line; but there is no proof of the
early adoption of either by the families concerned. The introduction
of the two setts last referred to was long posterior to the use of the
example illustrated, and they seem variations of the Drummond given by
John Sobieski Stuart in <cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite>. In the table to Logan’s
<cite>Scottish Gaël</cite> the Drummond scheme agrees with the present plate; but
the manufacturers, no doubt to avoid a multiplicity of patterns of the
same name, have, probably unwittingly, dropped the older of the two
designs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DRUMMOND OF STRATHALLAN.</h2>
</div>


<p>There is every reason to esteem this tartan of early date. Possessing
many characteristics of old design, it figures as Strathallan
Drummond in most of the trustworthy collections, including those of
The Mackintosh of Mackintosh, the Campbells of Craignish, and Messrs
Romanes &amp; Paterson, Edinburgh. An example of undoubted antiquity is
held by the Editor. In 1812 David, sixth Earl of Airlie, head of the
house of Ogilvy, married Clementina, only child of Gavin Drummond,
Esq., the third son of James Drummond of Keltie by Clementina, sister
and co-heiress of Alexander Graham of Duntrune, who was heir male of
John, Viscount of Dundee. On this event the tartan here represented, up
to that time known as Strathallan, appears to have been adopted by the
Earl and some other branches of the family, and in the course of time
the design came to be styled the Ogilvy, which is now its customary
designation; the ground has sometimes been made blue instead of green.
The appropriation is somewhat extraordinary, because the Ogilvys
possess a fine tartan of their own (Plate XXX.), which can be traced at
least as far back as last century. Mr and Mrs Nisbet-Hamilton-Ogilvy
have an interesting portrait (ascribed to Allan Ramsay) of David, Lord
Ogilvy, afterwards sixth Earl of Airlie (attainted), who raised a body
of cavalry for Prince Charles Edward and fought at Culloden. The coat
displays a simple check in red and blue, and the plaid an effective
tartan scheme in these colours. Indeed, the picture is supposed to
represent the uniform of Ogilvy’s Horse of 1745-46.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="FRASER">FRASER.</h2>
</div>


<p>The accompanying reproduction is taken from a specimen in a collection
formed about 1790, where the pattern is first recorded. Different
Fraser families appear originally to have had each their special
designs, but for a long time every important section (save that of
Lovat, whose tartan forms the next plate) has recognised this as the
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Breacan Friosalach</i>. Collections following one another at brief
intervals from 1790 to 1850, comprising those of the Highland Society
of London, the Campbells of Craignish, the late Dr. W. F. Skene, and The
Mackintosh of Mackintosh, present it unvaryingly as the clan tartan.
Paintings, both early and important, of branch representatives disclose
variations which seem to indicate that certain families were wont to
have the details slightly altered for their own uses. The pattern
usually offered as Fraser, while bearing some resemblance to that
illustrated in Plate IX. as Fraser of Lovat, is most likely an old
tartan of Clan Grant (see the Grant, Plate X.), and its association
with the Clan Fraser is based on its occurrence in the <cite>Vestiarium
Scoticum</cite>. Some account of the Fraser and other family portraits
showing Highland costume was contributed by the Editor to <cite>The Scottish
Antiquary</cite>, Vol. VIII. See also the notes on the Fraser of Lovat
tartan.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FRASER OF LOVAT.</h2>
</div>


<p>Confirmation of the supposition that various branches of Clan Fraser
wore tartans similar in scheme but different in detail is furnished
by the family portraits. In a fine presentment of Major James Fraser
of Castle Leather (whereof a replica hangs in Inverness Town Hall),
painted about 1723, a red pattern is shown in the plaid, while the rest
of the dress is a simple check in red, green, and blue. Portraits of
the Hon. Sybella Fraser of Lovat and the Hon. Mrs Archibald Fraser of
Lovat, executed after the middle of last century, in the collection of
Sir William Augustus Fraser of Ledclune, have different red setts in
the plaids. Miss Fraser of Abertarff possesses an interesting likeness
of her father, dated 1808, that supplies yet another arrangement in
red. The present illustration depicts the earliest authenticated Lovat
pattern, which is accepted, moreover, by the leading collectors. In
1849 Lord Lovat wrote of the tartan generally styled Fraser (though, as
already mentioned, it is most probably Grant—Plate X.), that he had
ascertained it to be that of his clan prior to 1745. It is difficult
to accept the statement, since no trace of the design appears in the
Fraser paintings either at or before that period. On the other hand,
the pattern was undoubtedly in use then by a prominent member of Clan
Grant, of whom it is said that he continued to wear the Highland dress
for almost a century, as stated in the notes on the Grant tartan.</p>

<p>Reproduced from a portrait of Robert Grant of Lurg (1678-1777), in the
collection at Troup House. This example, as mentioned in the note to
Plate VIII., is identical with that now commonly styled the Fraser.
It was accepted by some only of the Fraser families in 1842, because
it was illustrated under their name in the <cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite>.
Of the Laird of Lurg there is another likeness, in the possession
of Lady Seafield at Castle Grant, which represents him in the Black
Watch tartan. The explanation offered is that he was an officer in the
Clan Grant Company of the Black Watch; that since his clan supported
the Government the prohibition against the national dress would not
be enforced in his case; and that it is but reasonable to suppose
he wore the tartan of his clan when not in military uniform. In
connection with the Grants occurs one of the earliest descriptions of
a distinctive clan design. It is dated 1704. It has been partially,
though inaccurately, quoted in Sir William Fraser’s <cite>Chiefs of Grant</cite>
(Edinburgh, 1883), and on account of its interest it is given in the
Introduction to this work. The illustration is not in absolute harmony
with the description, and appears, indeed, to be a modification of it.
Attention may again be directed to the resemblance between the Grant
and the Fraser tartans. The wide dissimilarity in the tartans depicted
in the Grant family portraits preserved at Castle Grant and elsewhere
is referred to in the Introduction.</p>

</div>


<p>The present example is designated Huntly and Brodie in certain early
collections, and, like those of Dunblane, Strathearn, and Atholl, it
appears to belong to a district rather than to a family. Tradition
shows it to have been in use during a considerable portion of last
century by such families as Gordon, Brodie, and Forbes, or at least
by members of these touched with Jacobitism, who appear to have
assumed this tartan in common, just as many families of different
name adopted a uniform wear in various localities. On the raising of
the Gordon Highlanders in 1794 a yellow stripe was introduced into
the Black Watch pattern for their regimental use; and since then the
Gordons have discontinued the use of the Huntly except on full-dress
occasions. In a beautiful painting of Miss Rebecca Forbes, daughter of
Sir William Forbes of Pitsligo, married in 1802 to Alastair Ranaldson
Macdonell, fifteenth of Glengarry, there is a dress of this tartan
which is known to have been used by her family in Aberdeenshire.
From information supplied by the late Dr. William Forbes Skene to Mr
Elphinstone Dalrymple, it is ascertained that the present Forbes
tartan was designed for the Pitsligo family in 1822 by another Miss
Forbes of Pitsligo. It was done by merely adding a white line to the
Forty-second; the Gordon was similarly obtained by the addition of a
yellow one, and this is now the sole difference between the wear of
the two principal families, Forbes and Gordon, who formerly wore the
Huntly.</p>

<p>Despite the uncertainty concerning the origin of this design, it is
included in every complete early collection, like that of the Highland
Society of London, of the late Dr. Skene, of Messrs Ogilvie &amp; Co., and
of Messrs Romanes &amp; Paterson. The last-mentioned firm has supplied it
from the early years of the present century to various families of
Keiths and Austins, including the house of Keith-Falconer, Earls of
Kintore. The Austins appear first on record as allies and supporters
of the Keiths. The name was variously spelt, though in ancient records
it was generally begun with Ou or Ow. Of curious interest as showing
an early connection between the families is the occurrence in 1587
of the name of Alexander Ousteane, burgess of Edinburgh, as one of
the cautioners for George Keith, Earl Marshall, in an action raised
against him by Margaret Erskine, Lady Pitcarie. In the same year
Alexander Oisteane, no doubt the same person, was a Parliamentary
representative of the Burgh of Edinburgh. In 1589, Walter Oustene, a
tenant in Lochquhan (a possession of the Keith family), was one of the
subscribers to a Bond of Caution imposed on a number of the landed men
in the shires of Aberdeen and Kincardine, binding them to keep the
peace in the struggles with the Catholic party headed by Huntly.</p>

<p>The tartan seems to have been first worn by Kennedy families in the
Lochaber district. Tradition avers that some centuries back Ulric
Kennedy, a scion of the Ayrshire Kennedys who came originally from
Ireland, settled in Lochaber, and that all bearing the name in this
locality are descended from him. In the Highlands they are known as Mac
Ulrics or Clan Ulric, and are said to have once mustered considerable
force. The design has been accepted by the Kennedys in Carrick, many of
whom adopted it last century as an emblem of their Jacobite sympathies.
Several early examples of the pattern are in existence, and one of
these is here reproduced in the exact tints of the original. As will be
seen in the plate, the single red stripe is scarlet and the two fine
red lines are crimson; but manufacturers, to save themselves trouble,
have been accustomed to vitiate the design by failing to mark this
distinction. It is noteworthy that the tartan bears little resemblance
to any other Lochaber design of ancient date, and that the Kennedys,
while generally allied with the Camerons, have ever maintained their
own colours. They regard as their chief the Marquis of Ailsa, who is
head of the Kennedys of Ayrshire.</p>

<p>The pattern here given is included in the collection formed by the
Highland Society of London, and it occurs in numerous others, including
that at Moy Hall, while it has borne this name for many years. Great
confusion has somehow arisen concerning the tartan of the family.
James Logan’s table in <cite>The Scottish Gaël</cite> furnishes a design totally
unlike the one afterwards illustrated in his joint work with Mac Ian,
<cite>The Clans of the Scottish Highlands</cite>. Messrs Smith, in their usually
trustworthy <cite>Authenticated Tartans of the Clans and Families of
Scotland</cite>, present the Logan designated as the Skene, with the comment:
“It appears in Mr Logan’s book, but we must confess it is a pattern
about the antiquity of which we entertain some doubts.” In point of
fact, Logan gives no Skene tartan in <cite>The Scottish Gaël</cite>, while the
pattern of Clan Donchadh of Mar or Skene supplied in the Logan-Mac Ian
collaboration is entirely different. That it is not Skene tartan is
attested by the fact that an example which belonged to the late Dr. W.
F. Skene (now in the possession of the Editor) is described as “Logan”
in his own handwriting. Its early and general use under that name
clearly justifies its inclusion in this collection.</p>

<p>Well-nigh forgotten and rarely encountered, save in the old
pattern-book or in the tartan collector’s museum, this design is
early, though its origin cannot be fixed with any certainty. It has
been supplanted by a comparatively modern pattern, known commonly as
the Malcolm but occasionally as the Mac Callum, which is the ancient
form of the name. The new scheme has existed some forty or fifty years
at least, as the Editor has received from a lady in Skye a specimen
in a portion of a silk dress her family has owned for about that
period without knowing the name of the tartan. In the collection of
the Highland Society of London (1822), in that at Moy Hall, and in
every other important repository of the kind, the Mac Callum as here
illustrated is ranked, and the Malcolm is wanting. It its believed that
the family, having lost trace of the old sett fifty or sixty years ago,
had the modern design prepared from the recollection of old people in
Argyllshire; but, as has frequently happened in similar circumstances,
the recovery of the original design shows that considerable deviation
had been made.</p>

<p>One of the most romantic stories associated with tartans is attached to
the fragment now reproduced. In the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh, is a
collection of MSS. in ten black-edged volumes bearing the title of <cite>The
Lyon in Mourning</cite>, the reference being to the misfortunes of the House
of Stuart. Fastened to the inner sides of the boards are many relics
of the pathetic experiences of Prince Charles during the interval
between his defeat at Culloden and his escape to France. The documents
were written and the mementoes gathered by Bishop Robert Forbes, an
enthusiastic Jacobite. Under a scrap of tartan with a bit of red lining
he has noted:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The above are pieces of the outside and inside of that identical
waistcoat which Macdonald of Kingsburgh gave to the Prince when he
laid aside the woman’s clothes. The said waistcoat being too fine
for a servant the Prince exchanged it with Malcolm Macleod. Malcolm,
after parting with the Prince, and finding himself in danger of being
seized, did hide the waistcoat in a cleft of a rock, where, upon his
returning home in the beginning of September 1747, he found it all
rotten to bits, except only as much as would serve to cover little
more than one’s loof, and two buttons, all of which he was pleased to
send to me. The waistcoat had lain more than a full year in the cleft
of the rock, for Malcolm Macleod was made prisoner sometime in July
1746.</p>
</div>

<p>In the MSS. a copy of Macleod’s letter is given, and it runs thus:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Reverend Dr. Sir,</p>

<p>You’l received from the bearer all that was to the for of the weast
Coat that the P. gave to me, because no Body cou’d get it where I put

<p class="right">I’m your very humble servant,<br>
MAL MACLEOD.</p>

<p>Rasay, October 13, 1747.</p>
</div>

<p>The MSS., sold by the bishop’s widow to Sir Henry Steuart of Allanton,
were acquired by Robert Chambers, who presented them to the Library.
An account of the MSS. appears in <cite>Chambers’s Jacobite Memoirs</cite>.

<h2 class="nobreak">MACDONALD OF KEPPOCH.</h2>
</div>


<p>The Macdonalds boast more tartans than any other clan, in consequence
of many branches having adopted setts differing from the clan pattern.
The Macdonalds of Keppoch, or Siol Mac Mhic Raonuill, did so. This
sept was not numerically strong as compared with others, for in 1745
its fighting men were estimated at three hundred. The illustration
represents a portion of the plaid the Keppoch of ’45 gave Prince
Charles Edward, long preserved at Moy Hall, but many years back divided
among various families. Of this chief it is recorded that, when the
Macdonalds refused to charge the Hanoverian army at Culloden, and stood
irresolute, slashing the turf with their claymores, he exclaimed, “My
God! Have the children of my tribe deserted me?” and dashed forward
on the enemy, to be immediately shot down. Recently the pattern has
fallen into desuetude, many entitled to wear it preferring the quieter
colours of the pattern now commonly known as Clan Macdonald. Several
variations of the Keppoch scheme exist, and old specimens differing
from the illustration are held by some to be authentic setts; but this
has always been admitted by leading authorities to be the Keppoch,
since the plaid presented to the Prince was presumably in the chief’s
pattern.</p>

<p>The extensive variations in the tartans styled Mackintosh are
attributable to the fact that Clan Chattan embraced many septs, more or
less nearly allied, who changed the pattern at will. But the chief’s
and the clan designs are now accepted as authoritative examples of
the early scheme. To the example here illustrated peculiar interest
attaches, since it is the sett worn by Prince Charles Edward in the
Mackintosh country. The Rev. A. Thomson Grant, of the Rectory, Leven,
from whom the specimen was obtained, writes: “The piece of tartan I
sent you was given me in September 1860 by Mrs Christina Mackintosh or
Grant, widow of the Rev. James Grant, minister of Cromdale. I was at
the time on a visit to Coulnakyle House, some miles above Grantown,
where Mrs Grant and her family then resided. Mrs Grant produced a piece
of tartan, which she confidently assured me was a piece of the kilt
worn by Prince Charlie while in the Mackintosh country. The kilt, she
added, was religiously divided among the then members of the chief’s
family and near relations, and the piece she possessed had come down
to her by regular descent from her ancestors of that time. When I was
bidding good-bye, Mrs Grant halved the piece of tartan, and gave me
that which is now in your possession.” The illustration reproduces the
colours and the dimensions in the original, which, though a small, is
yet a fine specimen of old hard tartan.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MAC INTYRE AND GLENORCHY.</h2>
</div>


<p>Wherever authentic records of tartans are preserved this design
appears, generally as Mac Intyre and Glenorchy, though occasionally
as Glenorchy alone. It seems to have partaken of the nature of a
district tartan, for the locality whence the title is taken was only
partly occupied by the Mac Intyres, who appear never to have attained
the strength of a clan. No Mac Intyre arms are matriculated in the
Lyon Register. They are found, however, in Burke’s <cite>General Armoury</cite>,
and the individual contributing them evidently regarded his family
as a sept of the Mac Donalds. The pattern in the illustration occurs
in the collection of the Highland Society of London (1822), and in
reproductions made in Edinburgh about 1820 from examples of ancient
designs procured in the Highlands near that time. In a collection
formed in 1790 there is a scheme differing very slightly from the
present illustration. Of the antiquity of the name Mac Intyre in Lorn
evidence is furnished by the traditions of a family who “possessed
the farm of Glenoe, in Nether Lorn, from about the year 1300 down to
1810. They were originally foresters of Stewart, Lord Lorn, and were
continued in their possession and employment after the succession of
the Glenorchy and Breadalbane families to this estate, by a marriage
with a co-heiress of the last Lord Lorn of the Stewart family in
the year 1435” (Stewart’s <cite>Highlanders</cite>, third edition, Vol. I. p.
82). General Stewart, writing in 1822, observes: “In like manner the
Athole, Glenorchy, and other colours of different districts were easily
distinguishable.” Doubtless this statement refers to the example here
given, because it is shown in all collections of importance gathered at
that date, when what is now commonly known as the Mac Intyre appears to
have been non-existent.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MAC LACHLAN.</h2>
</div>


<p>The accompanying tartan is one of two ancient designs bearing the same
name. It figures in all the collections formed in the early years of
the century, and an excellent example (the precise date of which,
however, is unknown) has been procured from Messrs Romanes &amp; Paterson.
The other design, to be found in a collection made in 1790, is shown in
an ancient piece of hard tartan with a simple check in red and green
about five-eighths of an inch square in the Editor’s possession. In
the <cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite> the Mac Lachlan is depicted as a brilliant
combination of yellow and black, being the sett in use by the present
Mac Lachlan of Mac Lachlan. The clan generally use a red and dark blue
design, which cannot be traced further back than 1850 to the Smiths’
and Smibert’s works. The existence of the tartan illustrated appears
to have been generally overlooked by the clan, a fact greatly to be
regretted, as it is one of the finest of the old clan setts. That the
illustration represents an early and authentic clan pattern of the Mac
Lachlan cannot be doubted, for it is the only example occurring under
that name in the collections of the Highland Society, the Campbells
of Craignish, The Mackintosh of Mackintosh, and many others. Several
members of a minor sept of the Mac Lachlans, followers of the Stewarts
of Appin, were slain in the campaign of 1745-46 while fighting in the
Appin Regiment. (See note under Stewart of Appin.)</p>

<p>One of the few tartans concerning whose antiquity no doubt appears
ever to have been suggested, the Mac Laine of Lochbuie ranks in every
extensive collection of old patterns, though till recently it was not
represented in any published work. Particularly fine examples are
preserved in the Willis collection and in that of The Mackintosh. The
design is generally woven in an open sett, which produces an admirable
effect. It is unique among old patterns, by reason of the quantity
of pale blue in its composition, that colour being usually reserved
for narrow lines. The date of its introduction is unknown, but its
use in the Western Isles last century is authenticated, and tradition
points to its early origin. Despite the fact that the clan followed
the Marquis of Montrose and joined the rising of ’15, it took no share
in the ’45; and it may consequently be presumed that the members, like
others in similar cases, continued to wear their tartan and dress after
these had been formally proscribed. The present Mac Laine of Lochbuie
wears also the hunting Mac Laine of Lochbuie, which, as he himself
points out, is of modern invention.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MACKEANE (MAC IAN).</h2>
</div>


<p>The <cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite>, already acknowledged as the earliest and
the most elaborate illustrated publication on tartan designs, was
edited by the late John Sobieski Stuart from a MS. stated to belong
to the sixteenth century. The MS. was printed and published in 1842,
with plates executed from drawings by Charles Edward Stuart, the
editor’s brother. Of course the drawings are but a development of the
descriptions in the MS. It need scarcely be added that the volume is
now rare and costly. The MS. was transcribed and illuminated in 1829
by Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, for whom Charles Edward Stuart prepared a
series of drawings which included several tartans not illustrated in
the published work. One of these is here reproduced, and Sir Richard
Urquhart, Knycht, the reputed author of the MS., thus describes it:
“Mackeane hethe four stryppes of Blak upon ain scarlett feilde, and
upon the scarlett sett ain spraig (sprainge) of yellowe of saxteen
threidis, havand thereto ain bordure of Blak of twa threidis.” The
Mac Ians, whose name is variously spelt in the early clan rolls and
elsewhere as M’Kane, Mac Coin, Mac Eoin, Clanayioun, &amp;c., were a branch
of the Clan Macdonald. That the use of the design was not confined to
this branch is evidenced by a contemporary portrait of Alastair Ruadh
of Glengarry (who was prominent in the ’45), in which he is depicted in
this tartan. The painting is in the possession of John Alastair Erskine
Cuninghame, Esq. of Balgownie, Perthshire, the last lineal descendant
and heir-general of Alastair Ronaldson Macdonell of Glengarry.</p>

</div>


<p>The traditions, songs, and records of the Mac Leans contain references
of a much earlier date to this tartan than do any authenticated
collection of, or published work on, particular designs. In a charter
of 1587-8 granting Hector Mac Lean, heir of Duart, certain lands in
Islay, the feu-duty is made payable in the form of sixty ells of cloth
of white, black, and green colours. On the suppression of the religious
houses the impost is again mentioned in connection with the assets of
the churches. This very curious feu-duty exigible in tartan is dealt
with, and the references contained in the charters printed in full, in
the Introduction. The old Gaelic song, “Moladh rann do Shir Eachainn
Mac Gillian Trath Dhubhairt,” has the following verse:—</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MAC LEOD.</h2>
</div>


<p>Diversity of opinion prevails concerning the tartan of the Mac Leods;
and, unfortunately, nothing was done to settle the dispute when
the Clan Mac Leod Society recently discussed the claims of rival
patterns. The inspection of important collections from 1785, the date
of the repeal of the statute against tartans, till the present day,
proves that the design here given invariably occurs under the family
designation. Certain Mac Leods claim and wear the Mackenzie tartan
as their own, though the appearance of both, under their respective
names, in old collections proves this to be an impropriety. The mistake
doubtless arose from the fact that when the 73rd Regiment was raised in
1777 it was commanded by a son of the Earl of Cromarty, whose courtesy
title was Lord Mac Leod, though his family name was Mackenzie, and
whose tartan was the dress of the corps. Of comparatively recent date,
the assumption has yet taken considerable hold, in consequence of its
adoption in several works relating to clan patterns. The Mac Leods
of Raasay wore a design in brilliant yellow whose authority is the
<cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite>. An examination of the portraits and relics at
Dunvegan Castle in Skye, the seat of Mac Leod of Mac Leod, has been
made in search of records of the tartan of the clan. It has revealed
the singular circumstance that in the only early portrait in tartan
dress, that of the chief painted by Allan Ramsay in 1768, red is the
predominant colour of the tartan plaid, while coat and trews are in
“Rob Roy” check. Logan has stated, from recollection, that the plaid
is in the Fraser pattern; but here he is in error. It is to be hoped
further investigation will elucidate the history of the tartan in the
painting referred to.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MAC NEILL.</h2>
</div>


<p>To establish the antiquity of this pattern of the Mac Neill it is but
necessary to mention that it occurs in many old collections, including
those of Craignish, Moy Hall, the Highland Society of London, and
Messrs Romanes and Paterson. Several branches of the clan have other
designs, but none is found in the ancient repositories either so early
or so often as that now illustrated. A hitherto unnoticed reference to
what is possibly the distinctive tartan of the Mac Neills appears in
<cite>The Grameid: an Historic Poem descriptive of the Campaign of Viscount
Dundee in 1689, by James Philip of Almerieclose, 1691</cite>, translated by
the Rev. Alexander D. Murdoch, F.S.A. Scot., for the Scottish History
Society, 1888. It reads: “The illustrious son of warlike Mac Neill
comes from the winding shore of Barra’s isle, around whom, as their
chief, a great company of the youth of his name presses on the right
hand and on the left. Carrying his battle-axe, he advances on foot,
panting as he goes, leading his tall clansmen, himself the tallest,
and his shoulders covered with a Tyrian mantle. He displays as many
colours woven into his plaid as the rainbow in the clouds shows in the
sunlight.” Whether or not the tartan here presented was that worn by
the chief in Dundee’s campaign cannot be determined, but, at least,
it is the sole pattern associated with the name having any trace of
red. The writer of the poem was a close observer, and many of his
descriptions of dress and arms are highly valuable; while the allusion
to “the winding shore of Barra’s isle” evinces an intimate knowledge of

<p>The Macpherson tartans present unwonted difficulty in consequence of
the multiplicity of setts, each having claims of its own. These are
(1) the Chief’s, (2) the Cluny, or full dress, (3) the Hunting, and
(4) the Clan tartans. The first, though one of the oldest designs, has
often been wrongly presented. Of the second, which was illustrated in
the <cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite>, the Cluny Macpherson of 1850 wrote to Messrs
Smith, then compiling a book of tartans, that:-</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The design was known as the Breacan Glas’ long before John [Sobieski]
Stuart was heard of in this country, although I rather think the
addition of the yellow stripe was introduced by him, or rather taken
from his MS., but, at all events, the tartan is an old Macpherson.</p>
</div>

<p>The <cite>Vestiarium</cite> had only been published eight years before (1842),
though strenuous efforts had been made to issue it in 1829. It is
evident from an unpublished correspondence between Sir Walter Scott
and Sir Thomas Dick Lauder that the chief of Cluny received his first
drawing of the tartan from the brothers Stuart—a fact obviously
unknown to his successor of 1850. Sir Thomas, writing to Sir Walter on
1st June 1829, observes:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Messrs Hay [the name at first borne by the brothers] have already
instructed several of the chiefs of clans who have had webs of the
true tartans made, and, as an instance of this, I may mention that
Cluny Macpherson appeared at the late fancy ball at Edinburgh in his
beautiful and genuine tartan as taken from the MS. ... which excited
universal admiration. Mac Leod has got a sketch of his splendid tartan.</p>
</div>

<p>There is no evidence of this second pattern having been in actual
use prior to 1829, the only authority of earlier date being the MS.
above referred to. The third design is identical with that illustrated
here, except that the ground is grey instead of white. In use for
many years, the fourth appears in some of the early collections. The
only Macpherson (other than that peculiar to the chief) found in the
earliest collections is that here given, and there is every reason
to believe it the pattern worn by the clan from the repeal of the
prohibitory statute to the middle of the present century, when the
white ground was exchanged for grey. It is not known why the alteration
was made.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">MAC RAE: HUNTING.</h2>
</div>


<p>The present illustration reproduces the pattern of a piece of old hard
tartan from a kilt believed to have been worn by a member of Clan Mac
Rae at the battle of Sheriffmuir in 1715. The fragment, now in the
author’s possession, bears internal evidence of great age, the style
of manufacture attesting its connection with the period to which it
has been assigned. A tartan somewhat akin to this, and having the same
name, is supposed to have been founded on an imperfect acquaintance
with the pattern here given. The design is poorly represented in the
<cite>Clans of Scotland</cite>, by Mac Ian and Logan. It has been styled Hunting
to distinguish it from a red Mac Rae, which agrees exactly with the
Prince’s Own (Plate XLII.) The Editor was unable to account for the
connection between the two latter till he discovered a plaid preserved
in a carefully authenticated collection in Inverness-shire, with the
description: “Mac Rae tartan plaid worn by Prince Charles Edward in
1745.” The plaid being a complicated sett, a large specimen is required
to show the complete design, and, either through inadequate patterns
or insistent copying, the portion containing the yellow lines has been
omitted from all representations of the tartan hitherto published.
Captain John Mac Rae of Kames Castle has furnished the following note
regarding a sett of tartan which has been worn in his family:—“When my
great-great-grandfather, John Mac Ra of Conchra, Lochalsh, was on his
way to Sheriffmuir from Kintail, some of his followers being without
stockings, the occupants of a shieling in which some of them lodged
spent the night in cutting out stockings for them from a web of cloth
which they had in the place. A piece of this web was in the possession
of my grand-aunt, Miss Flora Mac Ra of Ardintoul, from which she
knitted the accompanying hose when a girl at the end of last century.
Unfortunately, the original piece of cloth has been lost.” The tartan
may be described as consisting of squares of sapphire-blue and white,
a line of yellow passing through the former and one of red through the
latter.</p>

</div>


<p>From early times the war-cry and motto of the Menzies clan has been
“Geal ’us dearg a suas,” “Up with the red and white,” and this has
been held to refer to the tartan; but, as other hues are found in old
specimens, it is at least probable that both phrase and design may be
traced to the heraldic shield of the chief, which is argent, a chief
gules, the colours of the tartan as commonly known. In the hunting
pattern here reproduced the only change is the substitution of green
for red in the ground, and red for white in the stripes. The pattern
of Menzies tartan, signed and sealed by the chief of that day, in the
collection formed by the Highland Society of London in 1816-17, is an
arrangement of red, green, blue, and white, and an example of last
century date in the Editor’s collection is identical in sett. The use
of the red and white Menzies tartan as a design for hose was common
throughout the Highlands, as the ancient portraits of various families
prove, and this use of the sett is probably of earlier date than its
special adoption as the Clan Menzies wear.</p>

<p>The frequent use of tartans by non-Highland families during a long
period—certainly throughout the eighteenth century—has been noted
elsewhere. It is not suggested that these wore the dress to the same
extent as the inhabitants of the Western Highlands and Islands, but,
nevertheless, the use of tartans was popular in the South of Scotland
at the time of the Union of the Kingdoms, and for long afterwards.
About this period, probably, the design here illustrated came to be
adopted by the Montgomeries of Ayrshire. A fine example in old hard
tartan, from Dr. Skene’s collection, has been employed as a guide in
the reproduction of the sett. An examination of the historical relics
in the possession of the Earl of Eglinton, the head of the Montgomerie
family, at Eglinton Castle has furnished ample evidence of the early
use of the tartan as here illustrated. In 1757 the Honourable Archibald
Montgomerie, son of the Earl of Eglinton, received letters of service
to raise a regiment in the North. It was known as Montgomerie’s
Highlanders. The uniform, as appears from the Eglinton portraits
examined by the author, consisted of the Highland dress, but the tartan
worn was the Government or Black Watch sett, and not the Montgomerie
pattern.</p>

<p>An interesting record of the encouragement by this family of the
manufacture of tartans in Ireland about the year 1600 will be found in
the Introduction.</p>

</div>


<p>As has been indicated in the notes on Drummond of Strathallan, that
pattern has been generally worn by the Ogilvys since the families
became connected through marriage in 1812. The present illustration
shows what was known as the Ogilvy (see Drummond of Strathallan, Plate
VII.) before that date, though it has gradually sunk into abeyance. Of
its origin nothing is known. It was revived as late as 1850 in <cite>The
Clans of Scotland</cite>, by Thomas Smibert, but it was then imperfectly
represented. The collection of Mr and Mrs Nisbet-Hamilton-Ogilvy at
Biel contains, as has been said, a fine portrait of David, the Lord
Ogilvy of the ’45, who commanded Ogilvy’s Horse. It is a half-length
figure, and, while the coat is in simple red and blue check, the plaid
is more elaborate in design. Clearly limned is an effective arrangement
of red and blue, which are the only colours either in coat or plaid.
Mrs Nisbet-Hamilton-Ogilvy suggests that this tartan may have been
a special variety provided by Lord Ogilvy for his regiment. Careful
investigation of old collections, however, reveals no earlier pattern
attributed to the family than the one here given.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OGILVY: HUNTING.</h2>
</div>


<p>Generally styled the hunting Ogilvy, though sometimes merely the
Ogilvy, this example is found in all early collections. That of
the Highland Society of London (1822) contains an especially fine
example. In the Moy Hall collection the specimen is labelled Ogilvy of
Inverquharitie—its only appearance under that name. Nothing authentic
has been ascertained as to its first introduction, but traditions of
its long use are plentiful among the families entitled to wear it.
An ancient legend of the Ogilvys concerning their tartan has been
deemed to apply to this pattern, and to prove its antiquity. It is
averred that the fairies, displeased at the appropriation of so much
of their favourite colour (green) in the design, cast their influence
against the clan in one of its feuds, and brought about its overthrow.
Hence, according to the legend, the adoption of the pattern shown in
the preceding illustration. The tale has likewise been attributed to
the tartan commonly known as the Ogilvy, but restored to its proper
designation in this volume as Strathallan Drummond, where the same hue
is also predominant. But as that design was not adopted by the Ogilvys
till 1812—long after the date of the legend—this application is
obviously recent.</p>

<p>Careful and extended examination of the various authorities establishes
that the example here represented illustrates the earliest tartan worn
by members of the Clan Donnachie having red as the dominant colour.
The qualifying clause as to colour is introduced because, since the
plates for this work were prepared, the author has been indebted to Mr
Charles Robertson of Kindeace for a specimen of the recognised sett
worn by his family and other Robertsons in the North, wherein the
colours are mainly green and blue, with red and white lines. Familiar
enough to connoisseurs, this design was not generally esteemed ancient;
but Kindeace mentions that his family and others have long regarded
it as their oldest clan pattern, and he adds: “The late Strowan told
me the red was made in Atholl, and presented to his father, who never
used it. In those days it had a white line, which is never seen now.”
And this confirms the view that the illustration given is the earliest
form of the red tartan. That it is an early clan pattern there can be
no doubt, for it is duly recorded as such in the Craignish and Moy Hall
collections, and in others formed from ninety to one hundred years ago
by manufacturers and dealers in high repute.</p>

<p>The use of this design as Stewart tartan for a period extending back
to 1745, at least, is vouched by the records of manufacturers and
collectors alike. Specimens gathered about 1790, now in the author’s
possession, include an undated example, whose manufacture indicates
great age. It is titled Clan Stewart, and in many collections the
design appears as Old Stewart, so that it was obviously recognised as
the clan pattern. Probably it was employed, for the most part, as a
hunting tartan, by way of relief from the brilliancy of other designs
of the same name. The strong resemblance between this scheme and that
of the Atholl district tartan (popularly styled the Atholl-Murray),
suggests that at one time they were identical. It is known that the
pattern was much worn by the Stewarts of the Western Highlands, and
as these, with the Stewarts of Atholl, formed the clan, there is,
at any rate, a presumption in favour of a community of tartan at an
early date. A remarkable example of the old belted plaid, of a design
differing from the above in certain particulars but having the same
dominant features, has been shown to the Editor by Mrs Stuart of
Dalness. It is reported to be two centuries old, and to represent the
original sett of the tartan.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STEWART OF APPIN.</h2>
</div>


<p>For the source of the present illustration reference must be made to
the notes on the Stewart of Atholl tartan (Plate XXXIV.) The pattern is
identical with the Royal Stewart as now worn, except that the present
sett has four narrow green lines running through the large red squares.
In the <cite>Grameid</cite> (pp. 142-3) it is stated, in connection with Dundee’s
gathering at Lochaber in 1689, that “brave Stewart of Appin, ... with
the whole body of his clansmen, leaves the shores bordering Leven, ...
carrying blue banners charged with yellow figures, ... and wearing on
their lofty heads fur bonnets.” The passage, unlike portions dealing
with other clans, contains no mention of the tartan colours. During the
’45 the Appin Regiment bore itself gallantly for the Prince. The roll
of the killed and wounded in the campaign supplies interesting evidence
of the variety of minor septs often included in the larger clans. It is
compiled from memoranda made by Charles Stewart, nephew of Fasnacloich,
Captain in the Highland Army, and sometime Quartermaster-General and
Secretary to Prince Charles Edward. The list is as follows:—</p>

<p>Five tartans described in the MS. whence the <cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite>
was derived are omitted from that work. The illuminated transcript of
the document by Sir Thomas Dick Lauder and the drawings of designs
by Charles Edward Stuart, brother of the editor of the <cite>Vestiarium</cite>,
were kindly placed at the disposal of the Editor by Miss Dick Lauder.
In the Introduction will be found a lengthened reference to this
work, while some notes regarding it also appear in the list of works
hitherto published on the subject of tartans. It is believed that
the reproduction of these patterns will prove of interest; and,
accordingly, they are illustrated in Plates XXII. and XXXIV. to XXXVII.
of the present volume. The <cite>Vestiarium</cite> is enough of a bibliographical
rarity to be known to comparatively few, while the original MS.
is meanwhile quite unavailable. The scheme here represented bears
considerable resemblance to certain early setts of Royal Stewart,
but no record yet discovered indicates the period of its general use
in Atholl. There is reason to believe, however, that it constituted
the basis of the red tartan of Clan Donnachie or the Robertsons. The
well-nigh universal adoption of the Atholl district pattern (commonly
styled the Atholl-Murray) by the various septs in this part of
Perthshire precluded the extensive wear of any other. Hence this design
has remained almost unknown to the present generation.</p>

</div>


<p>Like the preceding design, this is one of the five tartans omitted from
the published <cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite>; and it differs from the Stewart
of Appin merely in the number and the tint of the lines intersecting
the red squares. In the same respects it differs also from the Royal
Stewart, the evolution of which is somewhat remarkable. When the Royal
Company of Archers adopted the Royal Stewart as their uniform early
last century, the tartan presented an aspect not easily reconciled
with its present setting—as the relics of the old dress show—but
the change has been very gradual. The wedding coat of Charles II.,
preserved in the collection of the Duke of St Albans at Bestwood, is
said to be adorned with ribbons of Royal Stewart. This example the
author has not yet had an opportunity of verifying. The Stewart of
Galloway is a family tartan, restricted in use to the house whose name
it bears, and its more immediate connections. It was in considerable
favour in the early years of the present century among families allied
to the Galloway Stewarts; but of its earlier use available records
afford no trace, though there is reason to regard its wear soon after
the Union of the Kingdoms as highly probable.</p>

</div>


<p>Of the early use of the various setts of the Stewarts little can
be gleaned, unfortunately, even from painstaking investigation at
the most likely sources. The pattern now submitted of the Stuart of
Bute is a reproduction of another of the drawings omitted from the
published <cite>Vestiarium Scoticum</cite>. It is clear from the correspondence
between Sir Walter Scott and Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, already mentioned,
that Charles Edward Stuart executed all the water-colours about 1829
(although the work edited by his brother was not published till
thirteen years later) for the transcript of the MS. whereon the book
is founded. The records of this, as of the previous design, point to
its use having been confined almost entirely to the family from whom it
derives its title, though others, more or less closely related, have
likewise claimed an interest in the wear. Whether or not the pattern
was employed by the Stuarts of Bute prior to the production of the MS.
by the father of the Stuart brothers has not been ascertained.</p>

<p>For this design there are records extending over a hundred years; and
it is credibly asserted that the tartan is of much greater antiquity.
Be this as it may, the pattern is placed under its proper name in many
collections formed early in the century. Somewhat inexplicable is the
fact that the tartan usually styled Mac Lean of Duart was greatly worn
by certain Wallaces down to about twenty years ago. It is, indeed,
frequently designated in old books of tartan relics as Mac Lean and
Wallace. Yet no record of either family furnishes any explanation of
this singular conjunction. The accumulation of evidence as to early
use by the Wallaces of the example here illustrated has now led to
its adoption by all bearing that name. It is a family tartan, for
the Wallaces were in no sense a clan; but its antiquity, and its
authenticity, entitle it to a place in this work.</p>

and subsequent inquiries have also failed to trace it. It is suggested
by him that the painting may be a portrait of Queen Mary in the tartan
of the Lennox district, to which Darnley belonged. Mr Elphinstone
Dalrymple, an authority on portraiture careful as eminent, believed in
the authenticity and age of the work; but, unfortunately, his papers
contain few notes concerning it or its history. It is to be hoped the
whereabouts of this interesting portrait may still be ascertained,
especially as it is deemed the earliest coloured representation of
tartan dress.</p>

</div>


<p>Of the many valuable relics of the ’45 treasured by the
Murray-Threipland family at Fingask, few possess greater interest than
the cloak of Prince Charles Edward, whence the present representation
is taken. It escaped the vandalism of the soldiery engaged in
suppressing the rising, and it has since been jealously guarded,
so that it is an unusually well-preserved example of the tartan
manufactured in the early and middle portions of last century. In the
notes on the Drummond of Perth, attention is directed to the fact that,
save for one fine line, that design is the same as this one. The reason
of the similarity is hard to find, but, as no heed has hitherto been
paid to the matter, information tending to elucidate the mystery may
yet be forthcoming.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FROM A PLAID WORN BY PRINCE CHARLES EDWARD AT HOLYROOD.</h2>
</div>


<p>The fragments employed in the preparation of this illustration are
portions of a plaid worn by Prince Charles Edward during his brief
sojourn in Edinburgh in 1745. On his departure he presented the garment
to Susanna, Countess of Eglinton, a belle of the day, at whose house
in the Canongate he was a frequent visitor. Divided by her among her
seven daughters, a portion was given by one of them—Lady Frances
Montgomerie—to her grand-niece, the late Mrs Erskine of Torrie, who
bequeathed it to the Rev. Henry Bruce, Dunimarle. Mr Bruce mentions
that Mrs Erskine, who assured him of the genuineness of the relic,
spoke of Lady Frances as having often conversed with the Prince.
Well-nigh a century back the tartan was cut up for slippers by the
daughters of Sir William Erskine of Torrie. It was thus greatly
mutilated, but enough remained intact to permit the rendering of the
design here given. Sir Arthur Halkett, Bart., in whose collection are
some small pieces of the plaid, lent these to ensure the reproduction
of the precise tints of the original.</p>

</div>


<p>Various circumstances tend to enhance the interest of this design,
which is especially associated by Jacobite enthusiasts with the memory
of Prince Charles Edward, and which was named during the campaign of
1745-46 from his personal use of it. Authenticated by specimens of
contemporary and immediately subsequent dates—invariably bearing the
legend of royal adoption—the tartan may be ranked amongst the earliest
clan patterns extant in fabric. It is undoubtedly an old pattern of the
Mac Raes; and it was certainly worn by the Prince in their territory.
But whether it was previously used by members of the clan, or whether
it was adopted by them as a compliment to the wearer, cannot be
determined. Tradition indicates, however, that the Prince was wont to
don the local colours of the various clans in his sojournments in their
respective districts. It is now generally known as Mac Rae; but in all
representations hitherto published the omission of the yellow lines has
produced confusion as to the true sett.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FROM A COAT WORN AT CULLODEN.</h2>
</div>


<p>Sufficient interest adheres to certain examples of tartan designs in
use a century and a half ago to warrant their inclusion in the present
work, even though these are associated with no clan or family. The
present illustration is a reproduction of the sett and the colouring in
a highly interesting and carefully preserved riding or military coat in
the collection of Mr Gourlay Steell, R.S.A., who kindly lent it for the
purposes of this volume. It has been publicly exhibited several times
both in Scotland and in France. In the Naval and Military Exhibition,
Edinburgh, 1889, where it was last shown, it was described as “Highland
Tartan Coat, worn by one of Prince Charles Edward’s attendants at
Culloden.” It belonged at one time to the late James Drummond, R.S.A.,
and previously to the late W. B. Johnston, R.S.A. Despite an uncommon
and daring colour scheme, the general result is pleasing and effective.
The greater part of the tartan is much faded; but as in certain
portions the tints are brilliantly displayed a faithful copy has been
obtained. Fabric and fashion alike testify to the antiquity of the
garment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FROM A PLAID FOUND AT CULLODEN.</h2>
</div>


<p>Similar in history to the preceding illustration is the design now
represented; but the fabric contains evidence of earlier manufacture
than the date of Culloden. Indeed, with the exception of two plaids
at Dunimarle, certified as having been at Sheriffmuir in 1715, the
writer knows of no example so large in size, and possessing so much
internal evidence of great age. It may, with every probability, be
assigned to the first years of last century, if not considerably
earlier. Nor is this incompatible with its appearance at Culloden,
since the long periods such things have been, and still are, preserved
in the Highlands have passed into proverb. The plaid, kindly lent by
Mr Gourlay Steell, R.S.A., for reproduction, shows an intricate and
unusual sett; and the single check, as here displayed, represents half
of the plaid, and is merely repeated in the other half. When shown in
exhibitions it has been catalogued “Highland Plaid, found on the field
of Culloden the day after the battle.”</p>

<p>The object of including this beautiful modern yet rare design in a
collection of Old and Rare Tartans is that collectors may possess a
pattern greatly desired by them. Hitherto, on account of the conditions
imposed on Messrs Romanes &amp; Paterson, Edinburgh, the manufacturers
of tartans to the Royal Family, it has been impossible, even for the
connoisseur, to procure an example of it. For the purposes of the
present work, however, Her Majesty the Queen has not only granted
permission for its publication here, but has also graciously afforded
information concerning its inception in the early years of the reign,
when the sett was designed by the Prince Consort. It has continued
to occupy a conspicuous position in the dress and appointments of
the Royal Family and its retainers, when these partake of a Highland
character. On the occasion of a Royal marriage, Her Majesty’s gifts to
the bride invariably include articles of costume of this tartan.</p>

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
